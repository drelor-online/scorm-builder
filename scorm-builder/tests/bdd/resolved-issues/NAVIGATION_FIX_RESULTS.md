# Navigation Bug Fix Test Results

## Summary
The navigation bug has been successfully fixed! The application now correctly navigates from Course Seed Input to AI Prompt Generator.

## Bug Description
Previously, when clicking "Next" on the Course Seed Input form, the app would:
1. Navigate to the prompt step momentarily
2. Reload project data and find no topics in metadata
3. Reset back to the seed step

## Root Cause
The `saveCourseMetadata` function was not including the `topics` array when saving metadata, causing the app to think it was a new project on reload.

## Fix Applied
Updated the following files to include topics when saving metadata:

1. **src/App.tsx** - Added topics to metadata in `handleCourseSeedSubmit`:
   ```javascript
   await storage.saveCourseMetadata({
     courseTitle: data.courseTitle,
     difficulty: data.difficulty,
     topics: data.customTopics,  // Added this line
     lastModified: new Date().toISOString()
   })
   ```

2. **src/components/CourseSeedInputRefactored.tsx** - Added topics to auto-save effect:
   ```javascript
   await storage.saveCourseMetadata({
     courseTitle,
     difficulty,
     topics: topicsArray,  // Added this line
     lastModified: new Date().toISOString()
   })
   ```

## Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests
- **Debug Navigation Test**: Successfully navigates from Course Seed Input to AI Prompt Generator
  - Console logs show: `currentStep: prompt`
  - Page displays: "AI Prompt Generator" heading
  - No console errors

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Some tests have timing issues with element selection
- Complete E2E flow tests need updating to account for the 2-second auto-save delay

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Create a new project
2. Enter course title and topics
3. Wait 2 seconds for auto-save
4. Click Next
5. Should navigate to AI Prompt Generator without resetting

## Next Steps
1. Update all E2E tests to include proper wait times for auto-save
2. Consider adding explicit save before navigation instead of relying on auto-save timing
3. Add more robust navigation tests to prevent regression
