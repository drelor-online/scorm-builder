# BDD Test Status Report

## Summary
- **Total Scenarios**: 180
- **Status**: Mixed - Core functionality tests pass, but many scenarios have timing issues

## Test Categories

### ✅ Working Tests

1. **Health Checks** (00-app-health-check.feature)
   - Application loads without errors
   - CSS loads correctly
   - Dark theme applied properly

2. **Basic Load** (00-basic-load.feature)
   - React app mounts successfully
   - CSS loads properly

3. **Basic Navigation** (00-basic-navigation.feature)
   - Dashboard loads with correct UI elements
   - Navigation structure visible

### ⚠️ Partially Working Tests

1. **Dashboard Navigation** (00-dashboard-navigation.feature)
   - Dashboard loads correctly
   - Create New Project button works
   - Form navigation has timing issues

2. **Navigation Tests** (10-navigation-comprehensive.feature)
   - Step definitions added
   - Dashboard flow updated
   - Some scenarios still have timing issues

### ❌ Known Issues

1. **Timing Issues**
   - Form elements not found within timeout
   - Auto-save timing conflicts
   - React render delays

2. **Duplicate Step Definitions**
   - Fixed most duplicates
   - Some ambiguous matches remain

3. **Mock API Issues**
   - File operations not fully mocked
   - Project persistence incomplete

## Recommendations

1. **Reduce Test Scope**
   - Focus on critical path tests
   - Split large test files
   - Use tags to run subsets

2. **Improve Wait Strategies**
   - Add explicit waits for React renders
   - Use data-testid consistently
   - Implement retry logic

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Run tests in parallel
   - Use headless mode for CI
   - Cache browser instances

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining timing issues in navigation tests
2. Add retry logic for flaky tests
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with subset of stable tests
4. Create visual regression test suite
5. Add performance benchmarks
