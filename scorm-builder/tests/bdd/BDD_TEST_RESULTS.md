# BDD Test Results Summary

## Test Execution Status

### Overview
- **Date**: 2025-07-25
- **Total Features**: 8 feature files
- **Status**: Tests cannot run due to Tauri dependency issues

### Key Findings

1. **Core Issue**: The SCORM Builder app is tightly coupled to Tauri APIs and cannot run in a regular browser environment
   - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'invoke')`
   - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'transformCallback')`

2. **Root Cause**: The app immediately tries to use Tauri APIs on startup (in React useEffect hooks) before any mock can be injected:
   - FileStorage initialization
   - Crash recovery checks
   - File association handling

3. **Mock Injection Timing**: Playwright's `addInitScript` runs before page scripts, but the app's bundled code executes and crashes before the mock can take effect. This is because:
   - Vite bundles all code together
   - React components mount immediately
   - Tauri API calls happen in component mount effects

### Test Results (Partial)

#### ✅ Passing Scenarios
- Basic app loading scenarios (with mock API)

#### ❌ Failing/Timing Out Scenarios
- Course Seed Input validation scenarios
- Navigation between steps
- Form validation tests

### Technical Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**: Tests are timing out after 60 seconds trying to find elements
2. **Console Errors**: Multiple Tauri API related errors in browser console
3. **Mock API Injection**: The mock Tauri API is defined but may not be injecting properly

### Recommendations

1. **Option 1: Modify App Code for Testing** (Recommended)
   - Add environment variable check before Tauri API usage
   - Create a test mode that delays Tauri initialization
   - Example: `if (import.meta.env.MODE !== 'test') { useTauriAPIs() }`

2. **Option 2: Use Tauri WebDriver Mode**
   - Configure Tauri to expose WebDriver endpoint
   - Connect Playwright to Tauri's webview directly
   - Requires Tauri app configuration changes

3. **Option 3: Create Test Build**
   - Build app with mocked Tauri APIs included
   - Use build-time replacement to swap real Tauri with mocks
   - Requires webpack/vite configuration

4. **Option 4: Manual Testing**
   - Use the comprehensive test scenarios we created
   - Manually test against the running Tauri app
   - Document results for each scenario

### Conclusion

The BDD tests are well-structured with:
- ✅ 8 comprehensive feature files covering all app functionality
- ✅ ~53 step definitions implemented
- ✅ Page Object Model structure
- ✅ Mock Tauri API implementation

However, the app's tight coupling to Tauri APIs prevents browser-based testing without code modifications. The most practical approach for automated testing would be to modify the app to support a test mode that doesn't immediately require Tauri APIs.
