# BDD Step Definitions Implementation Status

## Summary
- **Total Scenarios**: 158
- **Implemented**: All major feature step definitions are complete
- **Undefined**: Some common navigation and setup steps still missing
- **Ambiguous**: Some scenarios have duplicate/conflicting steps

   - ✅ Preview functionality
   - ✅ Export options (SCORM 1.2, 2004, xAPI)
   - ✅ Validation and conformance testing
   - ✅ Deployment to LMS
   - ✅ Advanced settings and metadata

## Still Missing Steps

Based on test output, these common steps are still undefined:

### Navigation & State
- `Given I navigate to the SCORM Builder application`
- `When I enter the following course configuration:` (with table)
- `Given I have a clean project state` (in some test files)
- `Given I have valid API keys configured`

### Common Validation Steps
- Some error message validations
- API error handling steps

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- All major feature step definitions are fully implemented
- Playwright browser setup is working correctly
- Mock Tauri API is properly injected
- Page initialization happens correctly in Before hooks

### ❌ Main Issues Found
1. **Test failures are due to missing common navigation steps, not the main feature steps**
2. **Some tests try to use undefined steps like "Given I navigate to the SCORM Builder application"**
3. **The page object is properly initialized but some older test files still reference undefined steps**

## Recommendations

1. **Add the few remaining common navigation steps** to existing step definition files
2. **Fix ambiguous steps**: Review and consolidate any duplicate step definitions
3. **Create test fixtures** in `tests/fixtures/` for sample files:
   - Sample images for media enhancement tests
   - Audio files for narration tests  
   - Caption files for accessibility tests
   - JSON course data for validation tests

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Add missing common navigation steps** ✅ PRIORITY
2. Fix any ambiguous/duplicate step definitions
3. Add test fixtures for file upload tests
4. Run full test suite to verify all steps are working

## Testing Approach

Remember: These tests require the Tauri app to be running:
```bash
npm run tauri:dev  # In terminal 1
npm run test:bdd   # In terminal 2
```
