# Fixed BDD Tests

## Summary
The dialog flow tests have been updated to match the actual application behavior. The app uses a modal dialog for project creation, not direct navigation.

## Fixed Tests

### ✅ Working Tests (@working tag)
1. **Application loads dashboard successfully**
   - Dashboard renders with correct UI elements
   - "SCORM Builder Projects" heading visible
   - "Create New Project" button available

2. **Create new project and navigate to course seed**
   - Click "Create New Project" opens dialog
   - Project name can be entered
   - Create button works when project name is provided
   - Navigation to Course Seed Input form succeeds

### ✅ Fixed Navigation Tests (@fixed tag)
1. **Dashboard Navigation** (00-dashboard-navigation.feature)
   - Updated to handle dialog flow
   - Project creation works correctly

2. **Basic Navigation** (00-basic-navigation.feature)
   - Navigate to Course Seed Input scenario updated
   - Dialog interaction works properly

## Key Changes Made

1. **Dialog Detection**
   - Tests now wait for `.new-project-form` selector
   - Project name input found via `input[placeholder="Enter project name"]`

2. **Button Handling**
   - Create button found in `.modal-actions`
   - Button must be enabled before clicking
   - Proper wait times added for navigation

3. **Step Definitions**
   - Created `project-dialog.steps.ts` for dialog-specific steps
   - Removed duplicate step definitions
   - Added better error handling and debugging

## How to Run Fixed Tests

```bash
# Run only working tests
npm run test:bdd -- --tags @working

# Run fixed tests
npm run test:bdd -- --tags @fixed

# Run both
npm run test:bdd -- --tags "@fixed or @working"
```

## Next Steps

1. Add @fixed tag to more scenarios as they're updated
2. Update remaining tests that assume no dialog
3. Create a stable test suite for CI/CD
4. Document best practices for writing reliable E2E tests
