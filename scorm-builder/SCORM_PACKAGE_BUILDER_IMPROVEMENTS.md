# SCORM Package Builder - Design System Refactoring

## Summary of Improvements

The SCORM Package Builder has been successfully refactored using the design system following TDD principles, with the requested removal of Course Title and Description fields.

### âœ… Key Changes:

   - Tests for design system components
   - Tests for success messages and alerts

2. **GREEN Phase**: Implemented component to pass tests

   - Added course information summary
   - Used design system components
   - All 11 tests passing

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Replaced original component
