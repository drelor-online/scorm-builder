# SCORM Issue Resolution Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Fill-in-Blank Questions Not Showing

**Root Cause**: Duplicate `checkFillInBlank` function declarations in navigation.js
- An old commented-out version of the function was being included in the generated JavaScript
- The second declaration was overwriting the first, causing the function to have the wrong signature

**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed the commented-out duplicate function from `spaceEfficientScormGeneratorNavigation.ts`
- Now only one `checkFillInBlank` function exists with the correct signature

**Verification**:
- Fill-in-blank HTML is correctly generated with input fields
- The `checkFillInBlank` function is properly exposed to the window object
- Function signature matches what the HTML expects

### 2. Navigation Blocking Not Working

**Current Status**: The navigation blocking logic is implemented correctly in the code:
- `shouldBlockNavigation()` function exists and uses `window.courseTopics` data
- `getCurrentTopicData()` properly retrieves topic information
- Navigation blocking code is triggered on sidebar clicks and next button

**Potential Issues to Investigate**:
1. **Timing Issue**: The navigation state might not be initialized when the page loads
2. **iFrame Context**: The functions might not be accessible from the content iframe
3. **Event Handling**: Click events might not be properly attached to navigation elements

## Test Results

### Generated Files Analysis

1. **topic-1.html** (Fill-in-blank page):
   ```html
   <input type="text" id="fill-blank-0" class="kc-fill-blank" placeholder="Type your answer here">
   <button class="kc-submit" onclick="parent.checkFillInBlank(0, &quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;That's%20correct!&quot;, &quot;Not%20quite.%20Try%20again!&quot;, event)">Submit</button>
   ```
   ✅ Correctly generated with input field and submit button

2. **navigation.js**:
   - ✅ Only one `checkFillInBlank` function (line 1791)
   - ✅ `shouldBlockNavigation` function exists
   - ✅ `window.courseTopics` properly initialized with knowledge check data
   - ✅ Functions exposed to window object

3. **Course Topics Data**:
   ```javascript
   - topic-1: hasKnowledgeCheck=true, type=fill-in-the-blank
   - topic-2: hasKnowledgeCheck=true, type=multiple-choice
   - topic-3: hasKnowledgeCheck=false, type=none
   ```

## Testing Instructions

1. Open `test-output/scorm-debug/simple-test.html` in a browser
2. Load the SCORM package
3. Navigate to Topic 1
4. Verify fill-in-blank question appears
5. Try to navigate forward without answering (should be blocked)
6. Enter "Paris" and submit
7. Navigation should be enabled

## Next Steps

To fully resolve the navigation blocking issue:

1. **Add Debug Logging**: Add console.log statements in key functions to trace execution
2. **Check Event Listeners**: Verify sidebar click handlers are attached
3. **Test iFrame Communication**: Ensure parent-child window communication works
4. **Browser Testing**: Test in actual browser to see JavaScript console errors

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/spaceEfficientScormGeneratorNavigation.ts`:
   - Removed duplicate checkFillInBlank function (lines 1349-1403)

## Conclusion

The fill-in-blank rendering issue has been resolved by removing the duplicate function declaration. The navigation blocking logic is correctly implemented but may have runtime issues that need browser-based debugging to fully diagnose.
