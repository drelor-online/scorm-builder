# Media Enhancement Wizard - Design System Refactoring

## Summary of Improvements

The Media Enhancement Wizard has been successfully refactored using the design system with significant visual and functional improvements.

### âœ… Key Visual Improvements:

1. **Fixed HTML Rendering Issue**
   - **Before**: HTML content was displayed as raw code
   - **After**: Content is properly rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
   - Users now see formatted content instead of HTML tags

2. **Fixed Text Field Overflow**
   - **Before**: Search inputs were overflowing their containers
   - **After**: All inputs use the design system's Input component with proper `box-sizing`
   - No more visual glitches or layout breaks

3. **Consistent Card Layout**
   - Each section (Topic Content, Image Search, Video Search, etc.) is wrapped in Card components
   - Professional appearance with consistent padding and borders
   - Clear visual separation between different functional areas

4. **Better Button Organization**
   - Topic navigation buttons use consistent sizing and spacing
   - Search buttons are properly aligned with input fields
   - All buttons use the design system variants (primary, secondary, danger)

5. **Professional Alert Messages**
   - Success/info/warning messages use consistent Alert component styling
   - Clear visual feedback for media status
   - Proper color coding (green for success, blue for info)

6. **Grid Layout for Search Results**
   - Image and video results displayed in a responsive 2-column grid
   - Consistent card styling for each result
   - Hover effects for better interactivity

### ðŸŽ¯ Original Issues Resolved:

- âœ… **"This should not be shown as HTML code"** - FIXED with proper HTML rendering
- âœ… **"Text fields overhanging the container"** - FIXED with Input component
- âœ… **Button consistency** - FIXED with design system buttons

   - Flex layouts for button groups
   - Grid layouts for search results
   - Alert component for user feedback

2. **Consistent Styling**
   - All interactive elements use design system components
   - No more scattered inline styles
   - Proper spacing using design tokens

3. **Better UX**

### ðŸš€ Benefits:
