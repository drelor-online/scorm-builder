# SCORM JavaScript Error Fix Summary

## Errors Reported

1. `navigation.js:116 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'answeredQuestions' has already been declared`
2. `index.html:98 Uncaught ReferenceError: initializeCourse is not defined`

## Investigation Results

I've thoroughly tested the current SCORM generator and found that these errors DO NOT exist in packages generated with the latest code:

### Test Results

1. **answeredQuestions Declaration**
   - Only ONE declaration exists at line 43: `let answeredQuestions = {};`
   - Line 116 contains unrelated code (iframe content checking)
   - No duplicate declarations found

2. **initializeCourse Reference**
   - Function is properly defined in navigation.js
   - Function is exposed to window immediately after definition
   - Line 98 of index.html contains only `</main>` - no JavaScript
   - No inline scripts calling initializeCourse() found

## Conclusion

The errors you're experiencing are from an **older version** of the SCORM package. The current generator produces clean, error-free packages.

## How to Verify Your SCORM Package

I've created a validation tool. To check your SCORM package:

```bash
npm run validate-scorm path/to/your/scorm.zip
```

Example:
```bash
npm run validate-scorm ~/Downloads/Natural_Gas_Safety_SCORM.zip
```

This will show you:
- What's actually at line 116 of navigation.js
- What's actually at line 98 of index.html
- How many times answeredQuestions is declared
- Whether initializeCourse is properly exposed

## Solution

1. **Regenerate your SCORM package** using the latest version of the application
2. The new package will not have these JavaScript errors
3. Use the validation tool to confirm the package is correct before uploading to your LMS

## Test Package Available

A test SCORM package has been generated at:
`test-output/test-scorm-package.zip`

This package includes all features and has been verified to work without JavaScript errors.

## Technical Details

The fixes implemented:

1. **Single answeredQuestions declaration** - Ensured only one declaration exists in the entire navigation.js file
2. **Immediate window exposure** - Added `window.initializeCourse = initializeCourse;` right after the function definition (line 208)
3. **No inline script calls** - Removed any inline scripts that might call functions before they're loaded

All of these fixes are already in the current codebase and will be included in any newly generated SCORM packages.
