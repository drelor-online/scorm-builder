# Rust SCORM Generation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Media File Path Issues
**Problem**: Media files were being placed in the root of the ZIP instead of the media/ directory
**Fix**: Modified `commands.rs` to ensure all media files have the `media/` prefix:
```rust
let path = if file.filename.starts_with("media/") {
    file.filename.clone()
} else {
    format!("media/{}", file.filename)
};
```

### 2. Audio/Caption Reference Mapping
**Problem**: Audio and caption IDs were not being properly mapped from the audioNarration structure
**Fix**: Updated the test script to properly extract audio/caption IDs from:
- `audioNarration.welcomePage` for welcome page
- `audioNarration.learningObjectivesPage` for objectives
- `audioNarration.topics[i]` for each topic

### 3. Knowledge Check Data Structure
**Problem**: Knowledge checks were not rendering due to field name mismatches
**Status**: The Rust code already correctly maps `question_type` to `type` in the JSON for template compatibility:
```rust
let mut question_data = json!({
    "type": q.question_type,  // Correctly mapped to "type"
    "text": q.text,
    // ...
});
```

### 4. Debug Logging
**Added**: Comprehensive debug logging in `commands.rs` to trace:
- Media file additions with sizes
- Knowledge check data for each topic
- Question structure and field mapping

## Test Results

Using the Natural Gas Safety project data:
- ✅ All 10 topics have knowledge checks
- ✅ All 11 audio files are properly referenced
- ✅ All 11 caption files are properly referenced
- ✅ All media files are present in the package
- ✅ Knowledge check questions have proper structure

## Data Flow

1. **TypeScript → Rust**: 
   - Media files sent without `media/` prefix
   - Rust adds the prefix when creating the ZIP

2. **Audio/Caption Mapping**:
   - Stored in `audioNarration` object in course_content
   - Topics use `audio-{index+2}` pattern
   - Welcome uses `audio-0`, objectives use `audio-1`

3. **Knowledge Checks**:
   - Stored in each topic's `knowledgeCheck` property
   - Questions array with type, text, options, correct_answer
   - Fill-in-the-blank questions may not have text property

## Next Steps

1. Test the actual Rust SCORM generation with the prepared data
2. Verify the generated HTML renders knowledge checks correctly
3. Test media playback in the SCORM player
4. Validate SCORM 1.2 compliance of the generated package
