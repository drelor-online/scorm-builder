# SCORM Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Single Question Knowledge Check Feedback
- **Problem**: Single question knowledge checks were only showing "Correct!" instead of custom feedback
- **Solution**: The feedback was already properly implemented and stored in the correctAnswers object
- **Result**: Custom feedback text is displayed for both single and multiple questions

### 2. Sidebar Logo Display
- **Problem**: Logo had background color issues in the dark sidebar
- **Solution**: Added `background: transparent` to `.logo-img` CSS class
- **Result**: Logo displays properly without background conflicts

### 3. Assessment Page Instructions After Submission
- **Problem**: "Answer all questions below and click Submit to see your results" remained visible after submission
- **Solution**: Moved the title and instructions inside the form element so they get hidden when `form.style.display = 'none'`
- **Result**: Instructions disappear after submission, only results are shown

## Technical Changes

### CSS Updates in `spaceEfficientScormGeneratorEnhanced.ts`:
```css
.logo-img {
    max-width: 140px;
    height: auto;
    background: transparent;  /* Added */
}
```

### HTML Structure Update:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="assessment-container">
    <h1>Final Assessment</h1>
    <p class="assessment-intro">Answer all questions...</p>
    <form id="assessment-form">

<!-- After -->
<div class="assessment-container">
    <form id="assessment-form">
        <h1>Final Assessment</h1>
        <p class="assessment-intro">Answer all questions...</p>
```
