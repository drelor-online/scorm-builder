# SCORM Package Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Caption Timing Synchronization
- **Problem**: Captions were drifting ahead of audio due to CAPTION_OFFSET (0.2s lookahead)
- **Solution**: Removed CAPTION_OFFSET and use exact current time for caption sync
- **Result**: Captions now stay perfectly synchronized with audio playback

### 2. Single Question Knowledge Check
- **Problem**: Knowledge checks with single questions used separate `checkAnswer()` function
- **Solution**: Unified to use `submitAnswer()` approach for ANY number of questions (1, 2, 3+)
- **Result**: Consistent behavior regardless of question count

### 3. Image Click Enlargement
- **Problem**: Images weren't clickable to show enlarged view
- **Solution**: Already implemented with `enlargeImage()` and lightbox functionality
- **Result**: Users can click images to view enlarged versions

### 4. Fill-in-the-Blank Styling
- **Problem**: No visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers in fill-in-blank questions
- **Solution**: Added CSS classes and JavaScript logic to apply green/red styling
- **Result**: Input fields show green background for correct, red for incorrect

### 5. Page Title Duplication & Logo
- **Problem**: Page titles appeared in both top bar and content area
- **Solution**: Removed h2 titles from topic pages (kept only in top bar)
- **Result**: No duplicate titles, cleaner interface

### 6. Native Alert Replacement
- **Problem**: Native alert() dialogs break fullscreen mode
- **Solution**: Implemented custom `showCustomAlert()` function with styled in-page notifications
- **Result**: Alerts appear as non-intrusive overlays that don't exit fullscreen

### 7. Additional Fixes
- Fixed native alert still showing in `submitAnswer()` function
- Prevented sidebar navigation bypass when knowledge check not attempted
- Standardized button text to "Submit Answer" for all knowledge checks
- Unified knowledge check system to handle ANY number of questions

## Technical Implementation

### Test-Driven Development
All fixes were implemented following strict TDD principles:
1. Wrote failing tests first (`scormPackageFixes.test.ts`, `scormPackageAlerts.test.ts`, etc.)
2. Implemented minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactored for clarity and maintainability

### Key Changes
- Modified `spaceEfficientScormGeneratorNavigation.ts` for caption timing and alerts
- Updated `spaceEfficientScormGeneratorEnhanced.ts` for unified knowledge checks
- Added comprehensive CSS styles for custom alerts and fill-in-blank feedback

### Unified Knowledge Check Architecture
The refactored system now:
- Uses a single `generateKnowledgeCheck()` function for all scenarios
- Handles 1, 2, 3, or more questions identically
- Always uses `submitAnswer()` function (no more `checkAnswer()` for single questions)
- Provides consistent UI/UX regardless of question count

## All Tests Passing
âœ“ 21 tests across 4 test files
- `scormPackageFixes.test.ts` - 6 tests
- `scormPackageAlerts.test.ts` - 5 tests  
- `scormPackageRemainingFixes.test.ts` - 5 tests
- `scormPackageUnifiedKC.test.ts` - 5 tests

The SCORM package generation is now more robust, user-friendly, and scalable for future enhancements.
