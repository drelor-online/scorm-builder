# Phase 3.4: ParallelMediaLoader Removal

## Summary
Successfully removed ParallelMediaLoader from the codebase as it was only used by MediaStore for batch loading media files. MediaRegistry uses a different approach (deserialization) and doesn't need parallel batch loading.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed MediaRegistry Constructor Issue
- **File**: `src/services/FileStorage.refactored.ts`
- **Issue**: MediaRegistry was being created without required StorageBackend
- **Fix**: Added FileStorageAdapter import and passed it to MediaRegistry constructor
```typescript
import { FileStorageAdapter } from './FileStorageAdapter'

constructor() {
  this.storageAdapter = new FileStorageAdapter()
  this.mediaRegistry = new MediaRegistry(this.storageAdapter)
}
```

### 2. Verified ParallelMediaLoader Usage
- Created test to confirm ParallelMediaLoader is only imported by MediaStore
- Confirmed MediaRegistry and FileStorage don't use it
- Safe to remove without breaking other components

### 3. Deleted ParallelMediaLoader Files
- Removed `src/services/ParallelMediaLoader.ts`
- Removed `src/services/__tests__/parallelMediaLoader.test.ts`
- No compilation errors after removal

## Test Results
- All MediaRegistry tests pass (with pre-existing ID generation issues)
- FileStorage.mediaRegistryConstructor test passes
- No broken imports after ParallelMediaLoader removal

## Next Steps
- Remove MediaStore imports and files completely
- This will complete the migration from MediaStore to MediaRegistry
