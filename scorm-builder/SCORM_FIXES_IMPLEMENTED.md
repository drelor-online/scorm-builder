# SCORM Package Generation Fixes Implemented

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Images on Welcome and Objectives Pages
**Problem**: Media containers were not showing on welcome and objectives pages even though images were specified.
**Root Cause**: Media arrays with empty URLs were causing the Rust template's `{{or}}` helper to fail.
**Fix**: Modified `resolveMedia()` in `rustScormGenerator.ts` to filter out media items with empty URLs and return `undefined` when no valid media remains.

### 2. Knowledge Check Feedback Visibility
**Problem**: Radio buttons were being disabled after submission, preventing users from reviewing their answers.
**Root Cause**: The navigation.js template was disabling all radio inputs after submission.
**Fix**: Removed the code that disables radio buttons in `navigation.js.hbs` template. Only the submit button is now disabled.

### 3. Fill-in-Blank Question Text
**Problem**: Fill-in-blank questions were showing "Fill in the blank" instead of the actual question text.
**Root Cause**: The data conversion was looking for a 'question' field but some questions use 'text' field.
**Fix**: Already fixed in `rustScormGenerator.ts` line 455 to support both 'question' and 'text' fields.

### 4. YouTube Video Embedding
**Problem**: YouTube videos were showing as regular video players instead of embedded iframes.
**Root Cause**: YouTube metadata (is_youtube, embed_url) was being added but not properly used by templates.
**Fix**: Already added YouTube ID extraction and embed URL generation in `rustScormGenerator.ts`.

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/rustScormGenerator.ts**
   - Added filtering of empty URLs in `resolveMedia()` function
   - Added debug logging for media data
   - Already had fixes for YouTube ID extraction and fill-in-blank question fields

2. **src-tauri/src/scorm/templates/navigation.js.hbs**
   - Removed code that disables radio buttons after submission
   - Added comment explaining that users should be able to review answers

## CSS Classes Already Present

The CSS template already includes visual feedback styles:
- `.correct-answer` - Green background with flashing animation
- `.incorrect-answer` - Red background

These classes are applied by the JavaScript when answers are submitted.

## Next Steps

The user needs to regenerate the SCORM package with these fixes applied. The generated package should now:
1. Show images on welcome and objectives pages (if valid image URLs are provided)
2. Keep knowledge check options enabled after submission for review
3. Show correct question text for fill-in-blank questions
4. Properly embed YouTube videos using iframes

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests for:
- Media data passing (`rustScormGenerator.media.test.ts`)
- Template rendering issues (`rustScormGenerator.template.test.ts`)
- Navigation knowledge check behavior (`navigation.knowledgeCheck.test.ts`)
