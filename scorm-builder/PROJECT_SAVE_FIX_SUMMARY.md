# Project Save Fix Summary

## Issue
Projects weren't saving properly after architectural simplification that accidentally removed the FileStorage.ts service.

## Root Cause
1. FileStorage.ts (real Tauri storage) was deleted during simplification
2. App was falling back to MockFileStorage which only stores in memory
3. Project folders weren't being created, preventing media storage

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restored FileStorage.ts Service
- Recreated the deleted FileStorage.ts with full Tauri integration
- Implements proper .scormproj file handling
- Manages media storage in project folders

### 2. Created Backend Project Creation Command
- Added `create_project` command in Rust (commands.rs)
- Creates proper folder structure:
  ```
  /projects/
    /{project_id}/
      /media/
      {project_name}_{id}.scormproj
  ```
- Ensures media has a place to be stored

### 3. Fixed Parameter Serialization Issues
- Discovered Tauri expects camelCase parameters (e.g., `filePath`, `projectId`)
- Updated all invoke calls to use camelCase
- Added missing required fields (pitch, passing_score, etc.)

### 4. Fixed Project Path Handling
- ProjectDashboard now passes full paths instead of IDs
- Fixed deletion to use project paths
- Fixed project opening after creation

### 5. Added Defensive Checks
- MediaEnhancementWizard: Added check for `result.url` to prevent undefined errors

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `src/services/FileStorage.ts` - Recreated with full functionality
- `src/hooks/usePersistentStorage.ts` - Updated to use real FileStorage in Tauri
- `src/components/ProjectDashboard.tsx` - Fixed to use paths instead of IDs
- `src/components/MediaEnhancementWizard.tsx` - Added defensive check

### Backend
- `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` - Added `create_project` command
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Added import for new command

## Test Results
Created integration tests to verify:
✅ Project creation with proper folder structure
✅ Media storage in project folders
✅ YouTube video storage with proper metadata
✅ Project path handling for open/delete operations

## Verification
Checked actual file system and confirmed:
- Project folders are created at `/Documents/SCORM Projects/{id}/`
- Media folders exist within project folders
- .scormproj files are saved with proper naming

## Next Steps
The project save functionality is now fully restored. Users can:
- Create new projects with proper folder structure
- Save and load projects
- Store media files in project folders
- Delete projects with full cleanup
