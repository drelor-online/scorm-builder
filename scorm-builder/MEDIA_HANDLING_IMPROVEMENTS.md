# Media Handling Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed scorm-media:// Protocol
- **Before**: Media files were referenced as `scorm-media://projectId/mediaId` which required resolution
- **After**: Media files are referenced directly by their media ID (e.g., `image-abc123`)
- **Benefit**: Simplified code, removed unnecessary abstraction layer

### 2. Fixed Audio/Caption ID Preservation
- **Issue**: Audio and caption IDs were not being preserved through the conversion process
- **Solution**: Updated `courseContentConverter.ts` to preserve `audioId` and `captionId` fields
- **Result**: Audio narration and captions now properly linked to their pages

### 3. External Image Download
- **Issue**: External image URLs (from Unsplash, etc.) were not being downloaded for SCORM packages
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `rustScormGenerator.ts` to detect and download external images
  - Images are downloaded and included in the SCORM package
  - External URLs are converted to package-relative paths (e.g., `media/image-1.jpg`)
- **Result**: SCORM packages are self-contained with all images included

### 4. Simplified Media Resolution
- **Before**: Complex resolution logic for different URL types
- **After**: Simple approach:
  - External URLs (http/https) → Download and include
  - Media IDs → Load from FileStorage
  - Everything else → Use as-is

## Code Changes

### rustScormGenerator.ts
```typescript
// Simplified media resolution - no more scorm-media:// protocol
function needsMediaResolution(url: string): boolean {
  // Only external URLs need resolution (downloading)
  return isExternalUrl(url)
}
```

### courseContentConverter.ts
```typescript
// Direct media ID usage instead of protocol URLs
function resolveMediaUrl(media: Media | undefined): string | undefined {
  if ((media as any).storageId) {
    return (media as any).storageId // Use media ID directly
  }
  // Keep external URLs for download during SCORM generation
  if (media.url && isExternalUrl(media.url)) {
    return media.url
  }
  return undefined
}
```

## Test Coverage
- ✅ Audio/caption ID preservation tests
- ✅ External image download tests
- ✅ Media ID resolution tests
- ✅ Knowledge check data flow verification

## Impact
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Better performance (no unnecessary URL parsing)
- Self-contained SCORM packages with all media included
- Proper audio/caption synchronization
