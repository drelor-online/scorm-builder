# Audio Remove Confirmation Fix Summary

## Issue
The audio removal feature in the Audio Narration Wizard was immediately removing audio files when clicking the "Remove Audio" button, without giving users a chance to reconsider if they clicked it accidentally.

## Solution
Applied the same confirmation dialog pattern used in the Media Enhancement Wizard to provide a consistent user experience across the application.

## Changes Made

### AudioNarrationWizardRefactored.tsx
1. **Added ConfirmDialog import**
   ```typescript
   import { ConfirmDialog } from './ConfirmDialog'
   ```

2. **Added state management for confirmation dialog**
   ```typescript
   const [showRemoveAudioConfirm, setShowRemoveAudioConfirm] = useState(false)
   const [audioToRemove, setAudioToRemove] = useState<string | null>(null)
   ```

3. **Created handler functions**
   - `handleRemoveAudioClick`: Shows the confirmation dialog and stores which audio block to remove
   - `handleConfirmRemoveAudio`: Actually removes the audio after confirmation, including:
     - Revoking the object URL to free memory
     - Removing from the audioFiles map
     - Resetting dialog state

4. **Updated button onClick**
   - Changed from inline window.confirm to: `onClick={() => handleRemoveAudioClick(block.blockNumber)}`

5. **Added ConfirmDialog component**
   - Placed before closing PageLayout tag
   - Uses danger variant for destructive action
   - Clear messaging about the action being irreversible

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Same confirmation pattern as Media Enhancement Wizard
2. **Prevents Accidents**: Users must explicitly confirm audio removal
3. **Better UX**: Styled dialog that matches the application design
4. **Memory Management**: Still properly revokes object URLs when removing audio

## User Experience
When users click "Remove Audio":
- A styled confirmation dialog appears
- Title: "Remove Audio"
- Message: "Are you sure you want to remove the audio for this narration block? This action cannot be undone."
- Two clear options: "Cancel" and "Remove"
- Audio is only removed upon clicking "Remove"
