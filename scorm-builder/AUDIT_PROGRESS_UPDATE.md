# SCORM Builder Audit Progress Update

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. YouTube Video Handling (HIGH PRIORITY) - COMPLETED
- Added `embed_url` and `is_youtube` fields to Rust MediaItem struct
- Updated HTML generator to pass YouTube data to templates
- YouTube URL preservation logic implemented
- Integration tests added for YouTube flow

### 2. Duplicate SCORM Generators (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - COMPLETED
- All `spaceEfficientScormGenerator*` files removed
- Only Rust-based generator via `rustScormGenerator.ts` remains
- TypeScript generators completely removed

### 3. Component Refactoring - COMPLETED
- All "Refactored" suffixes removed from component names
- Test files updated to use new component names
- No more components with "Refactored" suffix

### 4. Test Infrastructure - COMPLETED
- Created centralized test provider wrapper
- Fixed "useStorage must be used within a PersistentStorageProvider" errors
- Updated 251 test files to use proper providers
- Tauri API mocking fixed

### 5. MediaStore Removal - COMPLETED
- MediaStore completely removed from codebase
- All components migrated to use MediaRegistry
- No references to MediaStore remain

### 6. Media ID Consistency Tests - COMPLETED
- Created comprehensive integration tests for media ID flow
- Tests cover: upload â†’ save â†’ reload cycles
- Tests for special characters, concurrent uploads, page switching
- Edge cases and error scenarios covered

### 7. False Issues in Documentation - PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- CLAUDE.md updated to mark resolved issues
- Audio indexing confirmed working correctly
- blockCount and knowledge check issues marked as false

## In Progress Tasks ðŸš§

None currently - ready to start next priority task.

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ“‹

### 1. Architecture Simplification (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Consolidate FileStorage.refactored.ts + FileStorageAdapter.ts + MediaRegistry.ts
- Remove unnecessary abstraction layers
- Create single, clear data flow from UI to storage
- Document the simplified architecture

### 2. Performance Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Implement proper blob URL cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Optimize parallel media loading
- Remove redundant caching layers
- Add performance monitoring

### 3. Security Improvements (LOW PRIORITY)
- Add URL validation for external media
- Implement path traversal protection
- Ensure API keys are not exposed in exports
- Add security tests

### 4. Update Documentation (LOW PRIORITY)
- Complete CLAUDE.md cleanup
- Create architecture diagrams
- Document final media flow
- Add troubleshooting guide

## Summary

We've successfully completed all the critical and high-priority issues from the audit:
- âœ… YouTube videos now display correctly as iframes
- âœ… MediaStore has been removed
- âœ… Test infrastructure is fixed
- âœ… Comprehensive tests ensure media ID consistency

The remaining work focuses on code quality improvements:
- Simplifying the architecture for better maintainability
- Optimizing performance
- Adding security hardening
- Improving documentation

## Next Recommended Action

Start with **Architecture Simplification** as it will make the codebase easier to maintain and understand. This involves consolidating the three media-related services into a simpler structure.
