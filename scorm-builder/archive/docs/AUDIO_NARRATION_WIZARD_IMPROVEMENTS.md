# Audio Narration Wizard - Design System Refactoring

## Summary of Improvements

The Audio Narration Wizard has been successfully refactored using the design system following TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology.

### âœ… Key Visual Improvements:

   - Bulk Audio Upload, Narration Blocks, and Upload Summary sections clearly defined

2. **Better Button Organization**
   - **Before**: Inconsistent button sizes and spacing
   - **After**: ButtonGroup components for logical grouping
   - All buttons use design system variants (primary, secondary, tertiary)
   - Consistent sizing with small/medium/large options

3. **Professional Alert Messages**
   - Upload success messages use consistent Alert component styling
   - Clear visual feedback with color-coded alerts (green for success, blue for info)

   - Flex layouts for button arrangements
   - Grid layouts for upload sections
   - Alert component for user feedback

2. **Consistent Styling**
   - All interactive elements use design system components
   - No more scattered inline styles for common patterns
   - Proper spacing using design tokens
   - Box-sizing properly handled by Input component

3. **Better UX**

   - Visual indicators for uploaded files
   - Inline editing with proper save/cancel flow

4. **Accessibility**
   - Proper ARIA labels on buttons
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Clear focus indicators

### ðŸš€ TDD Process Followed:

1. **RED Phase**: Created comprehensive tests first
   - Tests for design system component usage
   - Tests for layout structure (Cards, Sections, Flex, Grid)
   - Tests for button consistency
   - Tests for edit functionality
   - Tests for file upload handling

2. **GREEN Phase**: Implemented component to pass tests
   - Created AudioNarrationWizardRefactored.tsx
   - Used all design system components
   - Maintained all original functionality
   - Fixed test issues with proper selectors

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Replaced original component
   - Backed up original as AudioNarrationWizard.original.tsx
   - Replaced with refactored version
   - All tests passing

### ðŸš€ Benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Changes to design system update all pages
2. **Consistency**: Same components and patterns as other refactored pages
3. **Professional Look**: Clean, modern interface matching other wizards
4. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
5. **No Visual Bugs**: All styling issues resolved

The Audio Narration Wizard now provides a polished, professional experience that matches the quality of other refactored pages in the application.
