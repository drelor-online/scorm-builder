# SCORM Builder Accessibility Testing Report

## Overview
This report documents the accessibility testing implementation for the SCORM Builder application. Accessibility tests have been created for key UI components to ensure WCAG compliance and proper keyboard/screen reader support.

## Components with Accessibility Tests

### 1. Modal Component (`Modal.accessibility.test.tsx`)
**Tests implemented:**
- ✅ Basic accessibility violations check with axe-core
- ✅ ARIA attributes (role="dialog", aria-modal, aria-labelledby)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Escape key to close)
- ✅ Focus management
- ✅ Screen reader announcements
- ✅ Background interaction prevention
- ✅ Different modal sizes
- ✅ Scrollable content handling

**Key findings:**
- Modal component properly implements ARIA attributes
- Focus trapping needs manual implementation
- Close button is properly labeled

### 2. Button Component (`Button.accessibility.test.tsx`)
**Tests implemented:**
- ✅ Basic accessibility violations check for all variants and sizes
- ✅ Keyboard interaction (Enter/Space activation, tab navigation)
- ✅ Disabled state handling
- ✅ ARIA attributes support (aria-label, aria-describedby, aria-pressed)
- ✅ Color contrast verification
- ✅ Touch target size verification
- ✅ Button group accessibility

**Key findings:**
- Button component is simple but accessible
- Supports custom ARIA attributes through props spread
- Does not currently support loading states or polymorphic rendering

### 3. Input Component (`Input.accessibility.test.tsx`)
**Tests implemented:**
- ✅ Basic accessibility for all input types
- ✅ Label association
- ✅ Required field indication
- ✅ Error message association
- ✅ Disabled state handling
- ✅ Placeholder and help text
- ✅ Keyboard interaction
- ✅ Autocomplete support
- ✅ Character limit announcements

**Key findings:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for form inputs
- Proper label and error message association patterns
- Support for various input types including textarea

### 4. PageLayout Component (`PageLayout.accessibility.test.tsx`)
**Tests implemented:**
- ✅ Landmark regions (header, main, navigation)
- ✅ Skip links for keyboard navigation
- ✅ Heading hierarchy
- ✅ Workflow progress navigation
- ✅ Step indicators with aria-current
- ✅ Action button accessibility
- ✅ Responsive behavior
- ✅ Loading and error states

**Key findings:**
- Good landmark structure
- Workflow progress needs proper ARIA labels
- Skip links improve keyboard navigation

### 5. CourseSeedInput Component (`CourseSeedInputRefactored.accessibility.test.tsx`)
**Tests implemented:**
- ✅ Form structure and semantic HTML
- ✅ Label associations for all form controls
- ✅ Required field indication and explanation
- ✅ Error handling and announcements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation through form
- ✅ Select and slider accessibility
- ✅ Dynamic content (custom topics) handling
- ✅ Form submission accessibility
- ✅ Focus management on errors

**Key findings:**
- Complex form with good accessibility structure
- Proper error handling patterns
- Dynamic content changes are handled accessibly

### 6. Toast Component (`Toast.accessibility.test.tsx`)
**Tests implemented:**
- ✅ ARIA live regions for announcements
- ✅ Appropriate politeness levels (polite vs assertive)
- ✅ Auto-dismiss timing
- ✅ Dismiss controls
- ✅ Multiple toast handling
- ✅ Focus management (doesn't steal focus)
- ✅ Color contrast for all toast types
- ✅ Position and visibility

**Key findings:**
- Proper use of live regions for announcements
- Error toasts use assertive announcements
- Focus management preserves user context

## Testing Tools and Approach

1. **jest-axe**: Automated accessibility testing using axe-core engine
2. **Testing Library**: Testing user interactions and ARIA attributes
3. **Manual test patterns**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader compatibility

## Key Accessibility Patterns Tested

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab order
   - Enter/Space activation
   - Escape key handling
   - Focus trapping in modals

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Live region announcements
   - Role attributes
   - State changes

3. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Color contrast (via axe)
   - Focus indicators
   - Touch target sizes

4. **Form Accessibility**
   - Label associations
   - Error message associations
   - Required field indicators
   - Help text

## Components Still Needing Accessibility Tests

Based on the analysis, the following components should have accessibility tests added:

1. **DeleteConfirmDialog** - Critical for preventing data loss
2. **UnsavedChangesDialog** - Important workflow interruption
3. **SearchInput** - Common interaction pattern
4. **AutoSaveIndicator** - Status updates for screen readers
5. **Alert** - Error/warning messaging
6. **Tooltip** - Additional information pattern
7. **MediaEnhancementWizard** - Complex multi-step form
8. **CoursePreview** - Content presentation

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix failing tests by updating component implementations where needed
   - Add missing ARIA attributes to components
   - Implement proper focus management in Modal component

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Create accessibility tests for remaining critical components
   - Add keyboard navigation tests for all interactive components
   - Implement skip links consistently across pages

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline
   - Create accessibility testing guidelines for new components
   - Regular accessibility audits with real screen readers
   - User testing with assistive technology users

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Components with tests**: 6 major components
- **Total accessibility tests written**: ~100 test cases
- **Key patterns covered**: Keyboard, screen reader, visual, forms
- **Automated testing**: Using jest-axe for WCAG violations

## Conclusion

The SCORM Builder application has a solid foundation for accessibility with tests covering the most critical user interaction patterns. The test suite provides automated checking for common accessibility issues and manual test patterns for complex interactions. Continuing this approach for remaining components will ensure a fully accessible application.
