# Media Remove Confirmation Fix Summary

## Issue
The media removal feature was immediately removing media when clicking the "Remove Media" button, without giving users a chance to reconsider if they clicked it accidentally.

## Solution
Replaced the native `window.confirm()` dialog with a custom confirmation dialog component that provides a better user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created ConfirmDialog Component
- New reusable confirmation dialog component at `src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
- Features:
  - Customizable title, message, and button text
  - Support for different variants (danger, warning, info)
  - Proper styling consistent with the design system
  - Click-outside-to-cancel functionality
  - Proper z-index to appear above other modals

### 2. Updated MediaEnhancementWizardRefactored.tsx
- Removed dependency on `useConfirmDialog` hook
- Added state management for showing/hiding the confirmation dialog
- Split the remove functionality into two functions:
  - `handleRemoveMedia`: Shows the confirmation dialog
  - `handleConfirmRemoveMedia`: Actually removes the media after confirmation
- Added the ConfirmDialog component to the JSX

### 3. Updated Tests
- Modified all tests in `MediaEnhancement.removeConfirm.test.tsx` to work with the custom dialog
- Tests now properly wait for the dialog to appear and interact with the custom buttons
- Removed reliance on mocking `window.confirm`

## Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Custom styled dialog that matches the application design
2. **Prevents Accidents**: Clear confirmation step before destructive action
3. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation
4. **Consistency**: Uses the same design patterns as other dialogs in the app

## Usage
The confirmation dialog now appears when users click "Remove Media" with:
- Clear title: "Remove Media"
- Descriptive message: "Are you sure you want to remove the media from this topic? This action cannot be undone."
- Two clear options: "Cancel" and "Remove"
- Red styling to indicate it's a destructive action

The media is only removed if the user explicitly clicks the "Remove" button in the confirmation dialog.
