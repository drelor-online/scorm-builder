# SCORM Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Navigation.js was using hardcoded placeholder content instead of actual course data
2. Welcome and objectives pages weren't being loaded via iframe like other pages
3. Topic titles were generic "Topic 1", "Topic 2" instead of actual titles
4. Objectives page wasn't being generated at all

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Navigation Generator (`spaceEfficientScormGeneratorNavigation.ts`)
- Changed welcome/objectives pages to load via iframe for consistency
- Updated topic title display to use actual titles from `window.courseTopics` data
- Removed hardcoded placeholder content

### 2. Added Objectives Page Generator (`spaceEfficientScormGeneratorPages.ts`)
- Created `generateObjectivesPage` function to generate the learning objectives page
- Follows same pattern as welcome page with media support

### 3. Updated Main SCORM Generator (`spaceEfficientScormGenerator.ts`)
- Added import for `generateObjectivesPage`
- Added code to generate and include objectives.html in the SCORM package

## Result
- All pages now load consistently via iframe
- Actual course content is displayed instead of placeholders
- Topic titles show the real titles from course data
- The SCORM package now properly displays content as intended

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to ensure:
- No hardcoded content remains
- Topic titles are pulled from course data
- All pages use consistent iframe loading

All tests pass successfully.
