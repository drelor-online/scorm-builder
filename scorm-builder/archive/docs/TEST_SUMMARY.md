## Overall Progress

### Cleanup Achievements
- Removed 50+ unused files
- Fixed all build errors
- Removed unused SCORM generators (kept only enhancedScormGenerator)
- Cleaned up test files for non-existent components

### Current Test Coverage
Based on individual component tests:
- **Core utilities**: High coverage (>90%)
- **Services**: Good coverage (~60-90%)
- **Components**: Low coverage (~10-20%)
- **Overall estimate**: ~15-20% (up from 1.42%)

## Remaining High-Priority Tasks

1. **Critical Components** (for reaching 80% coverage)
   - MediaEnhancementWizardRefactored
   - AudioNarrationWizardRefactored
   - ActivitiesEditorRefactored
   - SCORMPackageBuilderRefactored
   - AIPromptGenerator

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete workflow test (from course creation to SCORM export)
   - Multi-step navigation tests
   - Data persistence tests

3. **Known Issues**
   - SCORM 2004 UI shows but only 1.2 is implemented
   - Many existing tests are failing due to:
     - Missing mocks
     - Changed component APIs
     - Deleted dependencies

## Recommendations

1. **Fix failing tests incrementally** - Many tests fail due to missing imports from cleanup
2. **Focus on critical path** - Test the main user workflow first
3. **Mock external dependencies** - Many tests fail due to unmocked APIs
4. **Update or remove outdated tests** - Some tests reference deleted components

## Test Execution Tips

```bash
# Run specific test files
npm test -- --run src/path/to/test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --run --coverage

# Run only passing tests
npm test -- --run src/utils/__tests__/sanitization.test.ts src/services/__tests__/enhancedScormGenerator.buffer.test.ts
```
