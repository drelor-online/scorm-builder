      <h2>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>
      <div class="content">
        Personal Protective Equipment is essential for electrical safety. Workers must wear appropriate PPE including insulated gloves, safety glasses, hard hats, and arc-rated clothing when working with electrical systems. Each piece of equipment serves a specific purpose in protecting against electrical hazards.

      <h2>Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment</h2>
      <div class="content">
        Identifying electrical hazards is crucial for workplace safety. Common hazards include exposed conductors, damaged equipment, overloaded circuits, and improper grounding. Workers must be trained to recognize these hazards and understand the associated risks before beginning any electrical work.

      <h2>Lockout/Tagout Procedures</h2>
      <div class="content">
        Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedures are mandatory when servicing electrical equipment. These procedures ensure that energy sources are properly isolated and cannot be accidentally re-energized while work is being performed. Only authorized personnel should perform LOTO procedures.

      <h2>Emergency Response Procedures</h2>
      <div class="content">
        In the event of an electrical emergency, quick and proper response can save lives. Know the location of emergency shutdown procedures, first aid equipment, and emergency contact numbers. Never attempt to rescue someone who is in contact with an energized electrical source without first de-energizing the circuit.
