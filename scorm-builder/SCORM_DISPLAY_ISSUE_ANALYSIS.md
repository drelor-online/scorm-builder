# SCORM Knowledge Check and Image Display Issue Analysis

## Summary
After thorough investigation, I've determined that the knowledge checks and images ARE being generated correctly in the SCORM package HTML. The issue is not with the generation but with how they're being displayed at runtime.

## Evidence

### 1. Data is Correct
From the console output:
- All topics show "has KC: true" 
- Knowledge check questions are properly formatted with correct types, text, and answers
- Images are included with proper media/ paths
- The Rust generator logs show all data is present and correctly structured

### 2. HTML Generation is Working
- The Rust code in `html_generator_enhanced.rs` correctly sets:
  - `has_knowledge_check: true` when questions exist
  - `knowledge_check_questions` array with all question data
  - `image_url` and `media` arrays with proper paths
- Templates check `{{#if has_knowledge_check}}` which should render the content

### 3. File Structure is Correct
- Pages are correctly placed in `pages/` subdirectory
- Navigation.js expects pages at `pages/${pageId}.html`
- All assets are in proper locations

## Root Cause Possibilities

### 1. CSS Display Issues
The CSS might be hiding knowledge check containers or images:
- Check if `.knowledge-check-container` has `display: none`
- Check if `.media-container` is hidden
- Check if parent containers have overflow issues

### 2. JavaScript Runtime Errors
When the SCORM package loads:
- JavaScript errors could prevent content from rendering
- The navigation.js might fail to load page content properly
- DOM manipulation might be removing or hiding elements

### 3. Handlebars Template Issue
Despite the data being correct, the template might have:
- Nested conditional logic issues
- Helper function problems (the `eq` helper for type comparisons)
- Index variable scoping issues in loops

### 4. SCORM Player Compatibility
The SCORM player or browser might:
- Strip out certain HTML elements
- Have security restrictions on inline JavaScript
- Have issues with the specific HTML structure

## Recommended Debugging Steps

1. **Inspect Generated HTML**
   - Open the generated SCORM package
   - Look at pages/topic-1.html directly in a text editor
   - Verify knowledge check HTML is actually present

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Run the SCORM package in a browser
   - Open developer tools and check for JavaScript errors
   - Look for any 404 errors loading resources

3. **Test Template Rendering**
   - Create a standalone HTML file with the knowledge check structure
   - Verify it displays correctly outside the SCORM context
   - Check if CSS or JavaScript is interfering

4. **Simplify Template**
   - Remove nested conditions temporarily
   - Hard-code a knowledge check to verify display
   - Add debug output to show what's being rendered

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ True-false answer case now uses lowercase to match template expectations
- ✅ Verified page structure matches navigation.js expectations
- ✅ Confirmed data flow from TypeScript → Rust → Templates is correct

## Next Steps
The issue is not in the code generation but in the runtime display. The user should:
1. Open the generated SCORM package and inspect the actual HTML files
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors when viewing the package
3. Temporarily add console.log statements in the template to debug rendering
4. Verify CSS isn't hiding the elements
