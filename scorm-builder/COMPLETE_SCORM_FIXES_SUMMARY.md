# Complete SCORM Generation Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve SCORM package generation issues.

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. Command read_file not found Error ✅
**Problem**: When generating SCORM packages, the error "Command read_file not found" was thrown.

**Root Cause**: The `FileStorage.getMedia` static method was trying to invoke a non-existent Tauri command `read_file` instead of the correct `get_media` command.

**Fix**: Updated `FileStorage.getMedia` to:
- Use the correct command `invoke('get_media', ...)`
- Extract mediaId from paths that include directory or extension
- Handle the MediaData response structure correctly
- Convert number[] to Uint8Array

### 2. Empty Audio/Caption Files (1KB) ✅
**Problem**: Audio and caption files in the generated SCORM package were empty (1KB) instead of containing actual content.

**Root Cause**: The static method was returning empty data when the projectId didn't match the currently loaded project.

**Fix**: The fix for issue #1 also resolved this issue by properly calling the `get_media` command which loads files from any project.

### 3. External Image URLs Being Broken ✅
**Problem**: External URLs like `https://example.com/image.jpg` were being prefixed with `media/`, resulting in `media/https://example.com/image.jpg`

**Fix**: Modified `ensure_media_path` in `html_generator_enhanced.rs`:
```rust
fn ensure_media_path(path: &str) -> String {
    // Don't modify external URLs
    if path.starts_with("http://") || path.starts_with("https://") || path.starts_with("//") {
        path.to_string()
    } else if path.starts_with("media/") {
        path.to_string()
    } else {
        format!("media/{}", path)
    }
}
```

### 4. True-False Questions Not Rendering ✅
**Problem**: The Handlebars template only handled "multiple-choice" and "fill-in-the-blank" questions, not "true-false"

**Fix**: Added true-false question handling to `topic.html.hbs` template.

### 5. External URL Download Fallback ✅
**Problem**: When external image downloads failed, the image URL was set to undefined

**Fix**: Modified `rustScormGenerator.ts` to preserve original URL on download failure:
```typescript
// If download fails, keep the original external URL
return imageUrl
```

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive tests to verify all fixes:
- `rustScormGenerator.fixes.test.ts` - Tests question type conversions and external URL handling
- `FileStorage.getMedia.test.ts` - Tests the static method for loading media with proper data format

## Impact
These fixes ensure that SCORM packages generated through the Rust backend will:
1. ✅ Successfully load media files without "command not found" errors
2. ✅ Include actual audio and caption content (not empty files)
3. ✅ Display external images correctly (stock photos, etc.)
4. ✅ Render all knowledge check types on every page
5. ✅ Handle YouTube videos and other external media properly
6. ✅ Work with any project, not just the currently loaded one

## Technical Details

### FileStorage.getMedia Changes
Before:
```typescript
invoke('read_file', {
  projectId: projectId,
  relativePath: flatPath
})
```

After:
```typescript
invoke('get_media', {
  projectId: projectId,
  mediaId: cleanMediaId
})
```

The method now:
- Extracts clean media ID from paths like "media/audio-0.bin" → "audio-0"
- Calls the correct Tauri command
- Handles the MediaData response structure
- Preserves MIME types from metadata when available

## Next Steps
The SCORM generation should now work correctly. The user can now generate SCORM packages without errors, and all media files will contain their actual content.
