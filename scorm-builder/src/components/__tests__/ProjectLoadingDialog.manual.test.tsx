MANUAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Run the app: npm run dev
2. Create or open a project with media files
3. Observe the loading dialog:
   - Should show "Opening Project" phase
   - Should progress through "Loading Media" with details about files
   - Should show "Loading Content" with topic count
   - Should show "Almost Ready" before closing
   - Dialog should NOT close and then show "Finalizing project load..." separately
   
4. The loading should be smooth with no gaps between dialog closing and app appearing

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Single unified loading experience
- No separate "Finalizing project load..." screen
- Detailed progress messages throughout
- Phase indicator dots showing progress

// Summary of changes made:
// 1. Modified App.dashboard.tsx to keep ProjectLoadingDialog open until 100% complete
// 2. Removed MediaLoadingWrapper from App.tsx that was showing separate finalizing screen
// 3. Enhanced usePersistentStorage to provide detailed progress messages
// 4. Updated ProjectLoadingDialog with better UI and phase indicators
//
// The fix ensures that:
// - Loading dialog stays open throughout entire loading process
// - No gap between dialog closing and app appearing
// - More detailed progress information shown to user
// - Smooth transition from loading to ready state
