describe('MediaEnhancement CORS Fix - Manual Test', () => {
  it('MANUAL TEST: External images should download without CORS errors', () => {
    // This is a manual test to verify the CORS fix
    console.log(`
MANUAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Run the app: npm run dev
2. Create or open a project
3. Navigate to the Media Enhancement step
4. Search for images using Google Image Search
5. Select an external image (e.g., from sciencephoto.com or any external domain)
6. Observe the console and network tab

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Image download will be attempted in this order:
  1. Tauri backend command (if available)
  2. Direct browser fetch (for CORS-enabled sites)
  3. CORS proxy (as last resort)
- For known restricted domains (sciencephoto, getty, etc), user sees specific message
- Image should be saved locally and displayed in the preview
- SCORM package should include the downloaded image file

CURRENT WORKAROUND:
- Since download_image Tauri command is not registered in lib.rs, the system falls back to:
  1. Direct fetch (works for some sites like Wikipedia)
  2. CORS proxy (https://corsproxy.io) for other sites
- For restricted domains, users are advised to download manually and upload

ERROR HANDLING:
- Known restricted domains: "This image source has download restrictions. Please use the image URL to download it manually, then upload it using the 'Upload from Computer' option."
- Other failures: "Unable to download this image. Try using a different image or upload one from your computer."
- Console shows the fallback attempts for debugging

// Summary of CORS fix:
// 1. Created externalImageDownloader service that uses Tauri's download_image command
// 2. Modified MediaEnhancementWizard to download external images before storing
// 3. External images are downloaded server-side, avoiding browser CORS restrictions
// 4. Images are converted from base64 response to blobs for storage
