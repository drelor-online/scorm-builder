# BDD Test Status Report

## Summary
We have successfully set up BDD testing for the SCORM Builder application with mock Tauri API support. The app loads in the browser and we can interact with it through the Course Seed Input step, but navigation between steps is currently blocked.

## Current Status: Partial Success üü°

### Test Environment
- **Framework**: Cucumber.js with Playwright
- **Target**: Vite dev server at `http://localhost:1420`
- **Configuration**: ES modules with TypeScript support
- **Mock Strategy**: Comprehensive Tauri API mock injected via Playwright

## Accomplishments

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed BDD Test Module Resolution
- Converted from CommonJS to ES modules
- Created `cucumber.mjs` configuration file
- Updated all imports to use ES module syntax

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Dev Server Configuration
- Removed problematic `postcss.config.js` that was causing 500 errors
- Created `vite.config.bdd.ts` for test-specific configuration
- Set up proper environment variable handling with MODE='test'

### 3. ‚úÖ Implemented Comprehensive Mock Tauri API
- Mock includes both `__TAURI__` and `__TAURI_INTERNALS__`
- Injected via Playwright's `addInitScript` before page load
- Implemented all required commands:
  - Project management: `create_project`, `load_project`, `save_project`
  - API keys: `load_api_keys`, `save_api_keys`
  - File operations: `read_text_file`, `write_text_file`, `exists`
  - Dialog operations: `plugin:dialog|save`, `plugin:dialog|open`
  - Media operations: `get_all_project_media`
  - SCORM generation: `generate_scorm`, `save_scorm_package`

### 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Application Loading Issues
- Resolved API key loading errors with proper snake_case structure
- Fixed project storage initialization with complete data structure
- Dashboard loads successfully without errors
- Project creation flow works correctly

### 5. ‚úÖ Form Interaction Working
- Can fill course title input successfully
- Can add topics to the textarea
- Form data is properly entered and visible

## Current Blocker üöß

### Next Button Disabled Issue
The main blocker is that after entering valid form data (course title + topic), the Next button remains disabled:

```bash
‚úî When I enter "Test Course" as the course title
‚úî And I add a topic "Introduction"
‚úò Then the Next button should be enabled
```

**Investigation Results:**
- Form validation code requires: `courseTitle.trim().length > 0` AND at least one topic
- Both conditions appear to be met in the test
- The `isFormValid()` function is returning false for unknown reasons

## Test Structure

### Feature Files Created
1. `02-minimal-e2e.feature` - Basic project creation and course input
2. `01-course-seed-input.feature` - Comprehensive course seed input scenarios
3. `03-ai-prompt-generator.feature` - AI prompt generation step
4. `04-json-import-validator.feature` - JSON import/validation
5. `05-media-enhancement-wizard.feature` - Media library
6. `06-audio-narration-wizard.feature` - Audio narration
7. `07-activities-editor.feature` - Content editor
8. `08-scorm-package-builder.feature` - SCORM export

### Step Definitions Implemented
- ‚úÖ Dashboard navigation
- ‚úÖ Project creation dialog
- ‚úÖ Course seed input form interactions
- ‚úÖ Basic navigation steps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Step transitions (blocked by Next button issue)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Start dev server (keep running)
npm run dev

# Run all BDD tests
npm run test:bdd

# Run specific tag
npm run test:bdd -- --tags "@course-input"

# Run with headed browser for debugging
HEADLESS=false npm run test:bdd -- --tags "@course-input"
```

## Console Output Example
```
üé≠ Injecting mock Tauri API via Playwright...
‚úÖ Mock Tauri API injected
Mock Tauri invoke: get_projects_dir {}
Mock Tauri invoke: list_projects {}
Mock Tauri invoke: create_project {name: "Course Test"}
Mock Tauri invoke: load_project {project_id: "test-project-1"}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Form Validation**
   - Add console logging to `isFormValid()` function
   - Check if there are hidden validation requirements
   - Investigate if auto-save affects form state

2. **Alternative Testing Approach**
   - Try testing with unit tests first
   - Mock at component level instead of API level
   - Use React Testing Library for component tests

3. **Manual Verification**
   - Run app manually to understand exact behavior
   - Check browser DevTools for validation errors
   - Verify if there are timing issues with form updates

## Key Files

- `/tests/bdd/support/hooks.ts` - Mock Tauri implementation
- `/tests/bdd/steps/complete-e2e.steps.ts` - Main step definitions
- `/tests/bdd/features/02-minimal-e2e.feature` - Current test scenario
- `/src/components/CourseSeedInputRefactored.tsx` - Component with validation logic

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Unit Tests**: The complexity of mocking the entire Tauri API might be overkill for testing UI flows
2. **Component Testing**: Use React Testing Library to test components in isolation
3. **Manual E2E**: Consider using the actual Tauri app for true E2E tests
4. **Simplified Mocks**: Mock at a higher level (e.g., storage service) rather than low-level APIs
