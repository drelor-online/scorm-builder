# Logo and Content Overflow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Replacement
- **Issue**: The sidebar was showing a simple "ENTRUST" text instead of the full ENTRUST Solutions Group logo
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated `generateIndexHtml` to use an image tag: `<img src="assets/entrust-logo.svg" alt="ENTRUST Solutions Group" class="logo-img" />`
  - Added CSS styling for the logo with white filter for visibility on dark background
  - Created and included an SVG logo file in the assets folder

### 2. Content Overflow
- **Issue**: Content was getting cut off in the SCORM player
- **Fix**:
  - Added explicit CSS for `#content-area` and its iframe to ensure 100% width/height
  - Added proper overflow handling to topic pages with `overflow-y: auto`
  - Ensured content-layout has proper height management

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **spaceEfficientScormGenerator.ts**
   - Changed logo HTML from div/span to img tag
   - Added SVG logo generation and inclusion in assets folder

2. **spaceEfficientScormGeneratorEnhanced.ts**

## Result
