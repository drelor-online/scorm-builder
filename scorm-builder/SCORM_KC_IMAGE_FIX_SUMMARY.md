# SCORM Knowledge Checks and Images Fix Summary

## Root Cause Identified
The generated SCORM HTML files have empty knowledge check containers:
```html
<div class="knowledge-check-container">
    <h3>Knowledge Check</h3>
    
</div>
```

This indicates the Handlebars template is not iterating over the `knowledge_check_questions` array properly.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Debug Logging to Rust HTML Generator
- Added detailed logging in `html_generator_enhanced.rs` to trace:
  - Each question's type, text, and options
  - The prepared question data for templates
  - Whether questions are found in the rendered HTML

### 2. Fixed True-False Questions Missing Options
- Modified `rustScormGenerator.ts` to ensure true-false questions always have options array:
  ```typescript
  if (questionType === 'true-false' && !options) {
    options = ['True', 'False']
  }
  ```

### 3. Added Template Debug Comments
- Modified `topic.html.hbs` to include debug comments showing:
  - If `has_knowledge_check` is true/false
  - If the questions array is empty
  - The count of questions in the array

## Next Steps for User

1. **Regenerate the SCORM package** with the updated code
2. **Check the console output** for the new debug messages:
   - Look for "[HTML Generator] Question X: type=..." messages
   - Look for "[HTML Generator] ERROR: Knowledge check questions NOT found in rendered HTML!"
3. **Inspect the generated HTML** to see if debug comments appear
4. **Check if the eq helper is working** - The console should show "[eq_helper] Comparing..." messages

## Likely Remaining Issues

1. **Handlebars Helper Registration**: The `eq` helper might not be working correctly
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The template might be expecting a different structure than what's provided
3. **Template Syntax Issue**: The nested conditionals in the template might have a syntax problem

## How to Debug Further

1. Generate a new SCORM package and look for the debug output
2. If you see "ERROR: Knowledge check questions NOT found in rendered HTML!", it means:
   - The data is correct
   - The template is not rendering the questions
   - This points to a Handlebars template or helper issue

3. Open the generated HTML and look for the debug comments:
   - `<!-- DEBUG: has_knowledge_check=true, questions count=undefined -->` would indicate the array isn't being passed
   - `<!-- DEBUG: No questions found in knowledge_check_questions array -->` would indicate the each loop isn't finding questions

The core issue is that the Handlebars template is not properly iterating over the knowledge check questions array, despite the data being correctly prepared and passed to it.
