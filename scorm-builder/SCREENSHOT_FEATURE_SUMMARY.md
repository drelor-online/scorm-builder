# Screenshot and Debug Feature Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Automatic Screenshot on Failure
- Screenshots are automatically captured when any test fails
- Captures full-page PNG, HTML content, console errors, and page state
- Works for test statuses: FAILED, AMBIGUOUS, UNDEFINED, PENDING
- Files saved to `test-results/screenshots/` with timestamp-based naming

### 2. Debug Step Definitions
Created `debug.steps.ts` with the following capabilities:
- Manual screenshot capture: `When I take a screenshot named "name"`
- Before/after action screenshots
- Form input logging: `When I log all form inputs`
- Button logging: `When I log all visible buttons`
- JavaScript error checking: `Then I should see no JavaScript errors`
- Network idle waiting: `When I wait for network idle`
- Auto-save debugging: `When I debug auto-save`

### 3. CI/CD Test Suite Configuration
- Created `cucumber.ci.mjs` for stable test execution
- Added npm scripts:
  - `npm run test:bdd:ci` - Run stable tests for CI/CD
  - `npm run test:bdd:stable` - Run stable tests locally
  - `npm run test:bdd:debug` - Run debug scenarios
- Configured with fail-fast, retry, and multiple report formats

### 4. Documentation
- `DEBUG_AND_SCREENSHOTS.md` - Complete guide for debug features
- `CI_CD_SETUP.md` - CI/CD integration guide with GitHub Actions example
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude test artifacts

## Current Test Status

### Stable Tests (2 passing)
1. Create project with dialog
2. Fill course seed and navigate

### Under Evaluation
- Navigate back from AI Prompt (timing issues)
- Multi-step navigation scenarios

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `tests/bdd/steps/debug.steps.ts`
- `tests/bdd/features/12-debug-demo.feature`
- `tests/bdd/features/13-failure-screenshot.feature`
- `tests/bdd/features/14-screenshot-test.feature`
- `tests/bdd/DEBUG_AND_SCREENSHOTS.md`
- `tests/bdd/CI_CD_SETUP.md`
- `cucumber.ci.mjs`

### Modified Files
- `tests/bdd/support/hooks.ts` - Added screenshot capture in After hook
- `package.json` - Added new test scripts
- `.gitignore` - Added test artifacts
- `tests/bdd/features/11-stable-navigation.feature` - Removed @stable from flaky test

## Usage Examples

### Debug a failing test
```bash
npm run test:bdd:debug
```

### Run CI tests
```bash
npm run test:bdd:ci
```

### Capture screenshots manually
```gherkin
When I take a screenshot before "clicking submit"
And I click "Submit"
And I take a screenshot after "clicking submit"
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor test stability and add more tests to @stable tag
2. Set up actual CI/CD pipeline using the provided configuration
3. Use debug features to investigate and fix flaky tests
