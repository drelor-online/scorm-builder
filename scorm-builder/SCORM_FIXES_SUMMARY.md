# SCORM Generation Fixes Summary - Updated

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Knowledge Check Questions Not Rendering  ✅
**Problem**: Knowledge checks were only showing titles but no questions after the first page.
**Root Causes**: 
- In `html_generator_enhanced.rs`, the `.collect()` method was missing type annotation, causing improper collection of questions
- Template was expecting `type` field but Rust was sending `question_type` field
**Fixes Applied**: 
- Changed `.collect()` to `.collect::<Vec<_>>()` on line 122
- Fixed field name to use `type` instead of `question_type` for template compatibility
- Added support for true-false questions in options rendering

### 2. Audio/Caption Files Getting 404 Errors ✅
**Problem**: Audio and caption files were returning 404 errors due to double `media/` prefix in paths.
**Root Cause**: The Rust code was adding `media/` prefix to paths that already had it.
**Fix**: Added `ensure_media_path` helper function in `html_generator_enhanced.rs` to check if path already has `media/` prefix before adding it.

### 3. Images Not Displaying
**Problem**: Images showed empty src attributes and no YouTube videos were displaying.
**Root Causes**: 
- The `image_url` field was completely missing from the Rust struct definitions
- Media files were not being passed from TypeScript to Rust (command signature mismatch)
**Fixes Applied**: 
- Added `image_url: Option<String>` field to both `WelcomePage` and `Topic` structs in `generator_enhanced.rs`
- Updated template data generation in `html_generator_enhanced.rs` to include image_url for welcome and topic pages
- Updated `generate_scorm_enhanced` command to accept `media_files` parameter
- Added MediaFile struct to handle media data from TypeScript

### 4. TypeScript Compilation Errors ✅
**Problem**: FileStorage.getMedia was not available as a static method.
**Fix**: Added static method declaration and implementation in `FileStorage.ts`

### 5. True/False Question Handling ✅
**Problem**: True/false questions were not properly converting correct answers to the expected format.
**Fix**: Added special handling for true-false questions in `rustScormGenerator.ts` to ensure options are ['True', 'False'] and correct answer is properly capitalized.

## Files Modified

### Rust Files:
1. **src-tauri/src/commands.rs**
   - Updated `generate_scorm_enhanced` to accept `media_files: Option<Vec<MediaFile>>` parameter
   - Added MediaFile struct definition
   - Updated command to use provided media files instead of only loading from disk

2. **src-tauri/src/scorm/html_generator_enhanced.rs**
   - Fixed knowledge check collection with proper type annotation
   - Added `ensure_media_path` helper function
   - Added image_url to template data
   - Fixed field name from `question_type` to `type` for template compatibility

3. **src-tauri/src/scorm/generator_enhanced.rs**
   - Added `image_url` field to WelcomePage struct
   - Added `image_url` field to Topic struct

### TypeScript Files:
1. **src/services/FileStorage.ts**
   - Added static getMedia method declaration

2. **src/services/rustScormGenerator.ts**
   - Added special handling for true-false questions
   - Fixed correct answer formatting

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite in `rustScormGenerator.fixes.test.ts` to verify:
- Image URLs are properly included in generated SCORM data ✅
- Knowledge check questions are correctly formatted ✅
- Audio/caption paths don't have double media/ prefix ✅
- YouTube videos preserve their embed URLs ✅

All tests are passing, confirming the fixes work correctly.

## Summary
The main issues were:
1. **Data Structure Mismatches**: Field names didn't match between Rust and templates
2. **Missing Media Transfer**: TypeScript was sending media files but Rust wasn't accepting them
3. **Path Handling**: Double media/ prefixes were breaking file references

All issues have been resolved through systematic fixes to both the Rust backend and TypeScript frontend.
