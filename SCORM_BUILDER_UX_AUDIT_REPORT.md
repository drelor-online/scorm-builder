# SCORM Builder Application - User Experience Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive audit of the SCORM Builder application has identified several user experience issues that may impact usability and data integrity. The audit focused on destructive actions, UI consistency, navigation patterns, and save/load behaviors.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Destructive Actions Without Confirmation

#### HIGH PRIORITY: Direct Delete in OpenProjectDialog
**Location**: `src/components/OpenProjectDialogRefactored.tsx:165`
```tsx
<Button
  variant="danger"
  size="small"
  onClick={() => onDelete(project.id, project.title)}
>
  Delete
</Button>
```
**Issue**: The delete button directly calls the onDelete function without any confirmation dialog.
**Impact**: Users can accidentally delete projects with a single click.
**Recommendation**: Add a confirmation dialog before deletion.

#### Properly Implemented Confirmations
The following components correctly implement delete confirmations:
- **MediaLibrary**: Shows inline confirmation with Cancel option
- **MediaEnhancementWizard**: Uses confirmDialog hook
- **TemplateEditor**: Shows inline confirmation overlay
- **ActivitiesEditor**: Uses window.confirm for question removal
- **AudioNarrationWizard**: Uses confirm() for audio replacement

### 2. UI Inconsistencies

#### Button Placement Patterns
The application shows inconsistent button placement across different components:

**Standard Pattern** (Most components):
- Back button on the left
- Primary action (Next/Save) on the right

**Variations Found**:
- Some dialogs have action buttons centered
- Delete buttons sometimes appear inline with content, sometimes in button groups
- Confirmation dialogs use different layouts (inline vs modal)

### 3. Navigation and Data Loss Protection

#### Positive Findings:
1. **Unsaved Changes Protection**: The application properly implements beforeunload handlers through the `useUnsavedChanges` hook
2. **Navigation Guards**: When opening a new project, the app checks for unsaved changes and shows a dialog
3. **Autosave Feature**: Implements automatic saving at regular intervals

#### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Back Navigation**: Direct back navigation between workflow steps doesn't check for unsaved changes within the step
2. **Step Navigation**: Users can lose form data when navigating between steps if they haven't triggered the main save

### 4. Save/Load Behavior

#### Consistent Behaviors:
1. **Project-level saving**: Handled consistently through ProjectStorage service
2. **Autosave**: Works uniformly across all workflow steps
3. **Save indicators**: Toast notifications appear consistently

#### Inconsistencies:
1. **Save button availability**: Not all workflow steps have explicit save buttons
2. **Save timing**: Some components save on every change, others require explicit save action

## Additional Findings

### Missing Features in Similar Contexts

1. **Media Management**:
   - Media Library has delete confirmation ✓
   - No bulk delete option for multiple items
   - No undo capability after deletion

2. **Question/Activity Management**:
   - Individual question deletion has confirmation ✓
   - No bulk operations for questions
   - No reordering capability in some editors

3. **Project Management**:
   - Project deletion lacks confirmation ✗
   - Project duplication works well ✓
   - No project archiving option

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Add Delete Confirmation to OpenProjectDialog**
   ```tsx
   // Add state for delete confirmation
   const [deleteConfirm, setDeleteConfirm] = useState<string | null>(null)
   
   // Update the delete button
   onClick={() => setDeleteConfirm(project.id)}
   
   // Add confirmation dialog
   {deleteConfirm === project.id && (
     <ConfirmDialog
       message="Are you sure you want to delete this project?"
       onConfirm={() => {
         onDelete(project.id, project.title)
         setDeleteConfirm(null)
       }}
       onCancel={() => setDeleteConfirm(null)}
     />
   )}
   ```

2. **Standardize Confirmation Dialogs**
   - Create a consistent ConfirmationDialog component
   - Use it across all destructive actions
   - Ensure consistent button placement (Cancel on left, Confirm on right)

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Enhanced Navigation Guards**
   - Add step-level unsaved changes detection
   - Prompt users before losing form data within steps

2. **Consistent Button Layouts**
   - Create a ButtonGroup component with standardized layouts
   - Document button placement guidelines
   - Apply consistently across all components

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Add multi-select and bulk delete for media items
   - Add bulk operations for questions/activities
   - Include confirmation for bulk operations

### Long-term Enhancements

1. **Undo/Redo System**
   - Implement undo for destructive actions
   - Add operation history
   - Show "Undo" toast after deletions

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Add "Advanced" sections for complex operations
   - Implement collapsible sections for better organization
   - Add tooltips for destructive actions

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure all confirmation dialogs are keyboard accessible
   - Add ARIA labels for destructive actions
   - Implement focus management for dialogs

## Conclusion

The SCORM Builder application demonstrates good UX practices in many areas, particularly with unsaved changes protection and autosave functionality. However, the critical issue of missing delete confirmation in the OpenProjectDialog poses a significant risk of accidental data loss. Implementing the recommended changes will greatly improve the user experience and data safety of the application.

## Files Requiring Updates

1. **Critical**: `src/components/OpenProjectDialogRefactored.tsx` - Add delete confirmation
2. **Important**: Create standardized confirmation dialog component
3. **Enhancement**: Update all components to use consistent button layouts
4. **Future**: Implement undo/redo system for reversible operations
