00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.385 
Hello and welcome.

00:00:01.385 --> 00:00:06.009 
This course is your comprehensive guide to electrical safety in the workplace.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.858 
Over the next hour, we will delve into the critical aspects of working with electricity, from the basic principles that

00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:16.972 
govern it to the advanced procedures that protect us from its dangers.

00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:24.158 
We've structured this training to be engaging and practical, ensuring you walk away not just with theoretical knowledge, but with

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:29.200 
a confident understanding of how to apply these safety measures in your daily tasks.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.335 
We'll start with the fundamentals, building a solid foundation of how electricity behaves.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:43.496 
Then, we'll move into the practical skills of hazard identification and risk assessment, teaching you how to spot potential dangers

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:45.148 
before they become incidents.

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:52.346 
A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to protective measures, including the correct selection and use of Personal

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:58.781 
Protective Equipment, or PPE, and the critical life-saving steps to follow during an emergency.

00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:06.339 
We'll also cover the 'why' behind these rules, looking at the regulations from bodies like OSHA and the NFPA, and

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:10.696 
discussing the importance of incident reporting and continuous improvement.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:17.801 
Our goal is to foster a proactive safety culture, where safety is not just a rulebook, but a shared value

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:19.093 
and responsibility.

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:25.667 
By the end of this course, you will be better equipped to protect yourself and your coworkers from electrical hazards.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.513 
Thank you for taking this crucial step in prioritizing safety.
