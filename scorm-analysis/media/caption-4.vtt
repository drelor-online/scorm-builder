00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.894 
Identifying a hazard is only the first step.

00:00:02.894 --> 00:00:07.692 
To manage it effectively, we must assess the level of risk it presents.

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:12.432 
Risk assessment is a systematic process of thinking about what could go wrong.

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:18.646 
You ask two key questions: First, what is the likelihood that someone will be harmed by this hazard?

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:22.608 
And second, if they are harmed, how severe would the injury be?

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:29.608 
For example, an exposed wire in a busy walkway has a high likelihood of contact and can cause severe harm,

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:33.211 
making it a high-risk hazard that requires immediate attention.

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:38.264 
To control these risks, we use a strategy called the Hierarchy of Controls.

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:43.120 
This is a ranked list of control measures, from most effective to least effective.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
The most effective control is Elimination—getting rid of the hazard completely.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.819 
For example, de-energizing a circuit before working on it eliminates the electrical hazard.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:01:01.922 
If you can't eliminate it, you try Substitution—replacing the hazard with a safer alternative, like using a battery-powered tool instead

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:02.924 
of a corded one.

00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:07.896 
Next are Engineering Controls, which physically separate people from the hazard.

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:12.334 
This could be putting a permanent guard over exposed electrical components.

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:16.772 
After that come Administrative Controls, which change how people work.

00:01:16.772 --> 00:01:22.708 
This includes procedures like Lockout/Tagout, posting warning signs, and providing training.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:28.203 
The final and least effective control is Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE.

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:35.575 
While essential, PPE is the last line of defense because it doesn't remove the hazard itself; it only provides a

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:38.295 
barrier that can fail or be used incorrectly.

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:42.629 
Always aim to control hazards as high up the hierarchy as possible.
