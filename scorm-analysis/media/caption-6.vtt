00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.625 
Even with the best precautions, emergencies can happen.

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:09.015 
Your ability to respond quickly and correctly can mean the difference between life and death.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:13.685 
Let's go through the critical steps for responding to an electric shock incident.

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.403 
The absolute first rule is: do not touch the person.

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:20.483 
If they are being shocked, they are part of a live circuit.

00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:25.653 
Touching them will make you a part of that circuit, too, and you will also be electrocuted.

00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:28.524 
Your first priority is to break the connection.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:31.917 
The safest way to do this is to shut off the power source.

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:38.073 
This could mean hitting an emergency stop button, flipping a circuit breaker, or unplugging the equipment.

00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:43.413 
If for some reason you cannot turn off the power, you must find a way to separate the person from

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:45.088 
the source without touching them.

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:51.334 
Use an object that does not conduct electricity, like a dry piece of wood, a broom handle, or a piece

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:52.521 
of heavy plastic.

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.659 
Do not use anything metal or anything that is wet.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:02.895 
As soon as you have done this, or while someone else is doing it, call for emergency medical services immediately.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:08.494 
Once the power is confirmed to be off and the person is safe to touch, you can provide aid.

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:10.819 
Check if they are breathing and have a pulse.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:16.337 
If you are trained in CPR and it is needed, begin administering it until help arrives.

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:21.704 
In the case of an electrical fire, remember this crucial rule: never use water.

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:26.606 
Water conducts electricity and will make the situation far more dangerous.

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:29.558 
You must use the correct type of fire extinguisher.

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:37.200 
Look for one that is rated Class C, or a multipurpose ABC extinguisher, as these are designed for electrical fires.
