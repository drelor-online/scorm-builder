00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.161 
An effective safety program never stands still.

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:07.367 
It must be a living system that adapts and improves over time.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.447 
This concept is called continuous improvement.

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:14.467 
It means we are always looking for better ways to protect our people.

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:21.157 
A popular model for this is the PDCA cycle, which stands for Plan, Do, Check, and Act.

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:23.540 
Let's see how it works in practice.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.547 
First, you 'Plan.' This involves identifying an area for improvement.

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:33.194 
Maybe you've noticed from near-miss reports that there's confusion about a certain procedure.

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:37.841 
Your plan would be to clarify that procedure and provide updated training.

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:44.148 
The next step is 'Do.' Here, you implement your plan, but often on a small scale at first.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:48.772 
You might roll out the new procedure and training to a single team to test it out.

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:53.245 
This allows you to work out any kinks before a full-scale implementation.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:55.048 
Then comes the 'Check' phase.

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:57.245 
This is where you measure the results.

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.615 
You monitor the team's performance with the new procedure.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.452 
You ask for their feedback.

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:03.512 
Was it clearer?

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:05.117 
Did it improve safety?

00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:06.281 
Was it practical?

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.792 
This is a critical data-gathering step.

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:13.300 
Finally, you 'Act.' Based on the results of your check, you make a decision.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.428 
If the new procedure was a success, you act by implementing it across the entire organization, making it the new

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:21.209 
standard.

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:27.679 
If it wasn't successful, you also actâ€”by going back to the planning stage to try a different approach.

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:35.678 
This cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act ensures that our safety program is constantly learning and evolving, rather than being a static set

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.458 
of rules that never change.
