00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.467 
When you've exhausted all other options in the Hierarchy of Controls, Personal Protective Equipment becomes your essential barrier against harm.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:15.920 
But simply wearing PPE is not enough; you must select the right type, ensure it's rated for the hazard, and

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.606 
know how to inspect and wear it correctly.

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:22.510 
Let's cover some of the most critical items for electrical safety.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.241 
The most important are insulated gloves.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:32.427 
These are not ordinary work gloves; they are specifically designed and tested to protect you from electric shock up to

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:33.743 
a certain voltage.

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:38.901 
Always check the voltage rating on the glove and make sure it's higher than the voltage you're working with.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.561 
Before each use, you must inspect them for any damage.

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.654 
A tiny pinhole can be deadly.

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:50.741 
A common method is the air-leak test, where you trap air inside the glove to see if any escapes.

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:57.071 
For eye and face protection, you'll use safety glasses or, for higher-risk tasks, a face shield.

00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:02.647 
These protect you from flying debris, sparks, and the intense energy of an arc flash.

00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:06.841 
Always inspect them for cracks or scratches that could impair your vision.

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.558 
In environments with overhead hazards, a hard hat is non-negotiable.

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:18.620 
It protects your head not only from falling objects but also from accidental contact with overhead electrical lines.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.445 
Finally, for tasks with a risk of an arc flash—a type of electrical explosion—you must wear specialized Arc-Rated, or AR,

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:27.087 
clothing.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:34.300 
This material is designed to resist catching fire and self-extinguishes, protecting your skin from severe burns.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.771 
Remember, regular clothing can actually make an injury worse by melting or burning.

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:44.418 
PPE is your personal defense system; maintain it properly.
