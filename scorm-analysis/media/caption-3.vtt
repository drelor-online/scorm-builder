00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.563 
The best way to prevent an electrical incident is to identify and address hazards before they can cause a problem.

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:09.260 
This requires a vigilant and trained eye.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.489 
Let's discuss some of the most common electrical dangers you should be looking for.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.974 
First, always inspect cords and wires for damaged insulation.

00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:22.737 
Any sign of cracking, fraying, or exposed metal is an immediate red flag.

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:28.441 
This damage exposes the live conductor, creating a severe shock or fire hazard.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.159 
Second, be alert for signs of overloaded circuits.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.975 
If you notice that a circuit breaker trips frequently, or if an outlet or switch plate feels warm to the

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:39.743 
touch, it's a warning sign.

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:47.684 
Plugging too many devices into a single outlet, especially high-power ones, can lead to overheating and is a leading cause

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:49.139 
of electrical fires.

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:51.824 
Never 'daisy chain' power strips together.

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:54.265 
Third, check for proper grounding.

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:58.123 
That third prong on a power plug is a critical safety feature.

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:02.561 
It provides a path for fault current to travel to the ground instead of through you.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:05.977 
Never use a plug with a missing or broken ground pin.

00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:09.486 
Fourth, be extremely cautious in wet conditions.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.287 
Water is an excellent conductor of electricity.

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:20.402 
Operating electrical tools in damp or wet areas significantly increases the risk of a fatal electric shock because it drastically

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:22.913 
lowers your body's natural resistance.

00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:28.814 
Finally, always be aware of your surroundings, especially outdoors or in large open areas.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:35.168 
Identify the location of overhead power lines before you begin work with ladders, lifts, or cranes.

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:39.455 
Coming into contact with a high-voltage line is almost always fatal.

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:42.802 
Staying observant is a skill that saves lives.
