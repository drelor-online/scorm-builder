00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.536 
Our safety procedures are not arbitrary; they are based on well-established regulations designed to prevent injury and save lives.

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:16.759 
In the United States, the primary governing body for workplace safety is OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.035 
OSHA creates and enforces the laws that every employer must follow.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:28.744 
One of OSHA's most important regulations for anyone working with machinery is the Control of Hazardous Energy standard, more commonly

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:31.441 
known as Lockout/Tagout or LOTO.

00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.545 
This procedure is a life-saver.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:41.242 
It's a systematic process that ensures a piece of equipment is completely de-energized and cannot be accidentally turned back on

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.322 
while someone is performing maintenance or repairs.

00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:54.147 
It involves shutting down the equipment, isolating it from its energy source—like flipping a breaker—and then placing a personal lock

00:00:54.147 --> 00:00:59.108 
This guarantees that only the person who placed the lock can re-energize the equipment.

00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:16.479 
While OSHA provides the law, another organization, the National Fire Protection Association, or NFPA, provides the detailed 'how-to.' The NFPA

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.920 
It provides the detailed methodology for things like performing an arc flash risk assessment, which helps determine the level of

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.768 
danger from a potential electrical explosion.

00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:33.954 
It also specifies the safety boundaries to set up around live equipment and provides the criteria for selecting the correct

00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:35.989 
PPE for a given task.

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:42.227 
Together, OSHA's laws and NFPA's standards form the foundation of our electrical safety program.
