00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.553 
Finally, let's talk about the most powerful safety tool of all: a strong safety culture.

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:09.979 
A safety culture is the personality of a company when it comes to safety.

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.432 
It's what people do when no one is watching.

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:17.834 
It's the shared belief that safety is more important than any deadline or production target.

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.589 
So what does a strong safety culture look like?

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.856 
It's built on several key pillars.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.042 
The first is management commitment.

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:29.759 
Safety must be a core value championed from the very top of the organization.

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:38.261 
When employees see their leaders consistently making decisions that prioritize safety, even when it's difficult, it sends a powerful message.

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:41.109 
The second pillar is employee involvement.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:47.068 
In a strong culture, safety isn't just dictated from above; everyone is involved.

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:53.836 
Employees are empowered to stop a job if they see something unsafe, they are encouraged to report hazards, and their

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:56.765 
suggestions for improvement are taken seriously.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.739 
This leads to the third pillar: shared responsibility.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.043 
It's the understanding that safety is not just the job of the safety manager, but of every single person on

00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:07.580 
the team.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.982 
It's about looking out for your own safety, and also looking out for the safety of your coworkers.

00:01:12.982 --> 00:01:15.876 
The final pillar is open communication.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:22.474 
People must feel psychologically safe to raise safety concerns without any fear of being punished or ignored.

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:28.421 
When issues are discussed openly and honestly, problems get solved before they become accidents.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:35.088 
When these pillars are in place, safety stops being a program and becomes part of the organization's DNA.

00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:37.390 
It's how we do business, every day.
