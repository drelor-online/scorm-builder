00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450 
Before we begin, let's outline what you will achieve by the end of this course.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.064 
Our primary goal is to equip you with actionable knowledge.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:13.199 
First, you will gain the ability to describe the core principles of electricity.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:19.669 
This isn't just theory; it's the foundation for understanding why safety procedures are so critical.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.643 
You'll learn what causes an electrical shock and how to prevent it.

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:27.094 
Next, we will focus on your observational skills.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:33.467 
You will learn to confidently identify a wide range of common electrical hazards that might be present in your work

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:34.295 
environment.

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:41.067 
This includes everything from frayed cords to more subtle dangers like overloaded outlets and incorrect wiring.

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:45.296 
Building on that, you will be able to conduct a basic risk assessment.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:53.051 
This means you can look at a task involving electricity, analyze the potential risks, and determine the necessary steps to

00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:53.995 
mitigate them.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:56.610 
A key part of mitigation is protection.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.819 
Therefore, you will learn how to select the right Personal Protective Equipment for the job and, just as importantly, how

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:04.984 
to use it correctly.

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:09.260 
In the unlikely event that an incident does occur, you'll be prepared.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.030 
You will be able to outline the immediate, correct emergency procedures for responding to both electrical shock and electrical fires.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.110 
Furthermore, we will demystify key regulations.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.358 
You'll understand the purpose and main components of critical safety standards like OSHA's Lockout/Tagout procedure.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:35.217 
Finally, we will tie everything together by focusing on the bigger picture: fostering a robust safety culture and embracing the

00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:39.285 
concept of continuous improvement to ensure lasting safety.
