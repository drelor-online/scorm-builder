00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.216 
To master electrical safety, we must first understand electricity itself.

00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:08.644 
Imagine electricity as water in a system of pipes.

00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:13.082 
The amount of water flowing is the 'current,' measured in Amperes.

00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:17.288 
The pressure pushing that water is the 'voltage,' measured in Volts.

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:22.992 
Finally, any restriction in the pipe that slows the flow is 'resistance,' measured in Ohms.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:27.651 
These three concepts are linked by a fundamental principle called Ohm's Law.

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:32.008 
It states that Voltage equals Current multiplied by Resistance.

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:38.907 
This is crucial because it's the current, the flow of electricity, that poses the greatest danger to the human body.

00:00:38.907 --> 00:00:45.478 
Even a very small amount of current, as little as a few milliamps, can cause severe injury or death if

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.583 
it passes through the vital organs.

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:52.764 
The human body, especially when wet, can be a good conductor of electricity.

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:59.938 
If you touch a live electrical source, your body can complete the circuit, allowing current to flow through you, resulting

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:01.242 
in an electric shock.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:07.964 
The severity of this shock is determined by three factors: the amperage of the current, the path it takes through

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:14.051 
your body—for instance, across the heart is extremely dangerous—and how long you are exposed to it.

00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.073 
That's why we use materials that block this flow.

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:19.154 
These are called insulators.

00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:26.553 
Materials like rubber and plastic are excellent insulators and are used to cover wires and make the handles of tools.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:32.082 
Conversely, materials that allow electricity to flow freely are called conductors.

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:34.802 
Metals and water are common conductors.

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:39.345 
Understanding this distinction is the first step in protecting yourself.
