00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450 
All the procedures and equipment in the world are ineffective without proper training.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:11.013 
Training is what builds competence and confidence, turning rules on a page into safe work habits.

00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:17.723 
OSHA recognizes that not everyone has the same level of expertise, so it makes a crucial distinction between two types

00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:21.326 
of workers: qualified and unqualified persons.

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:29.476 
A 'Qualified Person' is someone who has been specifically trained to understand the operation of electrical equipment and, more importantly,

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.395 
the hazards associated with it.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:39.278 
They know how to de-energize circuits, how to perform Lockout/Tagout, how to select the right PPE, and how to work

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:42.346 
safely around energized components when necessary.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:45.867 
They have proven they can recognize and avoid the dangers.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:51.930 
An 'Unqualified Person,' by contrast, is anyone who has not had this specialized training.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.386 
This doesn't mean they are unskilled in their own job, only that they are not trained to deal with electrical

00:00:57.386 --> 00:00:58.086 
hazards.

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:05.775 
They should not be performing electrical work and must stay outside of established safety boundaries around exposed live parts.

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:10.132 
To maintain a safe workforce, training must be an ongoing process.

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:16.471 
'Initial Training' is given to all new employees to provide them with the foundational safety knowledge they need before they

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.867 
even start their job.

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:25.622 
'Task-Specific Training' is provided when a worker is assigned a new or particularly hazardous task, ensuring they are prepared for

00:01:25.622 --> 00:01:26.914 
its unique risks.

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:35.017 
And 'Refresher Training' is conducted at regular intervals, like once a year, to reinforce key concepts and update everyone on

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:37.900 
any changes to procedures or regulations.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.257 
A commitment to continuous training is a commitment to everyone's safety.
