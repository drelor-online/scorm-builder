00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.529 
A critical, yet often overlooked, component of a safety program is incident reporting.

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.957 
To truly prevent accidents, we must learn from them.

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:15.191 
This includes not just incidents that cause injury, but also 'near misses.' A near miss is an event that could

00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:18.271 
have caused harm but, by sheer luck, did not.

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:24.726 
For example, if a faulty tool gives someone a mild shock but doesn't cause an injury, that is a near

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:25.170 
miss.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.723 
Reporting this is just as important as reporting an actual injury, because it's a warning sign.

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:35.579 
It reveals a hazard that needs to be fixed before it leads to a more serious outcome.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.283 
The goal of reporting is not to place blame, but to identify the root cause of the problem.

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:42.888 
Was it faulty equipment?

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:44.540 
A gap in a procedure?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.168 
A need for more training?

00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:53.824 
By reporting every incident and near miss, you provide valuable data that helps the entire organization improve.

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.693 
This data allows safety managers to identify trends.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:01:04.751 
For instance, if multiple near misses are reported involving the same type of equipment, it signals a clear need to

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:06.763 
inspect or replace that equipment.

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:11.062 
A good incident report is clear, factual, and objective.

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:16.603 
It should document exactly what happened, where and when it occurred, and who was involved.

00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:23.209 
It's a snapshot of the event that allows for a thorough investigation into the 'why.' Remember, your report could be

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.383 
the key to preventing a future tragedy.

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:30.100 
A culture of transparent reporting is a hallmark of a safe workplace.
