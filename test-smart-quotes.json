      "content": "<h2>Properties of Natural Gas</h2><p>Natural gas is primarily composed of methane (CH4) and has several important characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Colorless and Odorless:</strong> In its natural state, you can't see or smell it</li><li><strong>Lighter than Air:</strong> Natural gas rises and disperses quickly in open areas</li><li><strong>Flammable Range:</strong> Burns when mixed with air at concentrations between 5-15%</li><li><strong>Non-toxic:</strong> However, it can displace oxygen in confined spaces</li></ul><h3>Mercaptan Odorant</h3><p>For safety, an odorant called mercaptan is added to give natural gas its distinctive 'rotten egg' smell, making leaks easier to detect.</p>",
      "narration": "Understanding the properties of natural gas is fundamental to working with it safely. Natural gas consists primarily of methane, making up about 70 to 90 percent of its composition, with smaller amounts of ethane, propane, and other hydrocarbons. One of the most important characteristics to remember is that natural gas is colorless and odorless in its natural state. This means you cannot see it or smell it without assistance. Natural gas is also lighter than air, with a specific gravity of approximately 0.6, which means it will rise and disperse in open areas. However, in confined spaces, this property can create dangerous accumulation near ceilings. The flammable range of natural gas is between 5 and 15 percent concentration in air. Below 5 percent, there isn't enough gas to ignite, and above 15 percent, there isn't enough oxygen to support combustion. For safety purposes, an odorant called mercaptan is added to natural gas, giving it that distinctive rotten egg smell that helps us detect leaks quickly.",
