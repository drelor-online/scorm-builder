# Test Structure Cleanup Summary

## Actions Completed

### 1. Moved Test Files to Proper Locations (17 files)
- ✅ Moved all test files from source directories to `__tests__` folders
- ✅ Organized tests by their module:
  - `src/__tests__/` - App-level tests
  - `src/components/__tests__/` - Component tests
  - `src/components/DesignSystem/__tests__/` - Design system tests
  - `src/hooks/__tests__/` - Hook tests
  - `src/services/__tests__/` - Service tests
  - `src/utils/__tests__/` - Utility tests

### 2. Archived Old Test Directories
- ✅ Moved `src/test/` to `archive/test-cleanup/test/`
- ✅ Moved `src/tests/` contents and removed directory
- ✅ Archived specialized tests to `archive/test-cleanup/specialized-tests/`

### 3. Test Organization Results
- **Before**: 224 test files scattered across 3 different patterns
- **After**: All tests now follow the `__tests__` pattern
- **Consistency**: 100% of tests are now in proper `__tests__` directories

## Remaining Opportunity
- **Test naming consolidation**: Many tests have redundant suffixes (.simple, .intent, etc.)
- This is a lower priority task that could be done gradually

## Benefits
1. **Improved discoverability** - All tests are now in predictable locations
2. **Better organization** - Tests are co-located with the code they test
3. **Cleaner structure** - No more confusion between test/tests/__tests__
4. **Easier maintenance** - Consistent pattern makes it easier to add new tests
