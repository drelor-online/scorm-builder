# SCORM Builder End-to-End Test Report
Generated: 2025-07-22

## Test Environment
- Platform: Windows (win32)
- Working Directory: C:\Users\sierr\Desktop\SCORM-Builder
- Application: SCORM Builder (Tauri + React)

## Testing Infrastructure Created

### 1. Automated Test Files
- `src/utils/testRunner.ts` - Core test runner with memory monitoring
- `src/utils/e2eTests.ts` - Comprehensive E2E test suite
- `src/utils/browserE2ETests.ts` - Browser console tests for project creation
- `src/utils/automatedUITests.ts` - UI workflow automation tests
- `src/components/TestChecklist.tsx` - Manual test checklist UI (Ctrl+Shift+T)

### 2. Available Console Commands
```javascript
// Run automated UI tests
runUITests()

// Test new project creation
testNewProject()

// Run full E2E test suite
runE2ETests()
```

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: New Project Creation (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Create test infrastructure
- [x] Run automated new project test
- [x] Verify project file creation
- [x] Test data persistence
- [x] Check memory usage (370MB → 15MB after cleanup)

### Phase 2: Old Format Compatibility
- [ ] Load legacy project
- [ ] Verify audio file migration
- [ ] Test media loading
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

### Phase 3: SCORM Generation
- [ ] Generate package with all media types
- [ ] Test audio playback
- [ ] Verify caption display
- [ ] Check knowledge check functionality
- [ ] Test assessment scoring

### Phase 4: Performance Testing
- [ ] Monitor memory usage throughout workflow
- [ ] Check for memory leaks
- [ ] Test with large projects
- [ ] Verify blob cleanup

### Phase 5: Media Functionality
- [ ] Test audio recording
- [ ] Test audio upload
- [ ] Test image upload
- [ ] Test Google image search
- [ ] Test YouTube video embedding

### Phase 6: Activities & Assessment
- [ ] Test knowledge check editing
- [ ] Test assessment creation
- [ ] Verify question types
- [ ] Test scoring logic

### Phase 7: Auto-save & Persistence
- [ ] Test auto-save functionality
- [ ] Verify project recovery
- [ ] Test concurrent editing
- [ ] Check data integrity

### Phase 8: SCORM in LMS
- [ ] Upload to test LMS
- [ ] Verify SCORM communication
- [ ] Test completion tracking
- [ ] Verify score reporting

## Known Issues Fixed
1. ✅ TypeError in knowledge check generation
2. ✅ Blank SCORM screen (field name mismatches)
3. ✅ Media ID mismatch (audio-0001 vs audio_topic-id)
4. ✅ Audio duration NaN display
5. ✅ Caption initialization failure
6. ✅ CORS image download issues
7. ✅ Memory leaks from unreleased object URLs
8. ✅ "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

## Testing Instructions

### To Run Tests:
1. Open the application in development mode
2. Open browser DevTools console (F12)
3. Run test commands listed above
4. For manual testing, press Ctrl+Shift+T to open test checklist

### What to Look For:
- Console errors (red text)
- Failed assertions
- Memory usage spikes
- UI freezing or slowness
- Data not persisting
- Media not loading

## Test Results - Phase 1

### Automated Test Results (9/10 Passed)
✅ Storage Initialization - Passed  
✅ New Project Creation - Passed (15.9s)  
✅ Course Metadata Persistence - Passed  
✅ Content Persistence - Passed  
❌ Audio Storage - Failed (blob not retrieved after save/reload)  
✅ Image Storage - Passed  
✅ Memory Leak Check - Passed (excellent cleanup)  
✅ Invalid Project ID Handling - Passed  
✅ Storage Not Initialized - Passed  
✅ Cleanup Test Project - Passed  

### Key Findings:
1. **Project Creation Works** - Projects are created successfully with proper file structure
2. **Data Persistence Works** - Course metadata and content save/reload correctly
3. **Memory Management Excellent** - Memory properly cleaned up (370MB → 15MB)
4. **Image Storage Works** - Images stored as blobs and retrieved correctly
5. **Audio Storage Issue** - Audio saves but blob not retrieved on reload (base64Data missing)

### Audio Storage Bug Details:
- Audio is stored with base64Data during storeMedia()
- After save/reload, base64Data is empty
- This may be related to how audio is serialized/deserialized
- Images work correctly, so the issue is specific to audio handling

## Next Steps
1. Fix audio storage blob retrieval issue
2. Run manual UI tests with TestChecklist (Ctrl+Shift+T)
3. Test with actual audio recording/upload
4. Move to Phase 2: Old Format Compatibility testing
