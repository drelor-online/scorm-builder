# SCORM Builder Security Audit Repository

This repository contains the comprehensive security audit and fixes for the SCORM Builder application.

## Contents

### Security Documentation
- **SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Complete security vulnerability analysis
- **SECURITY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step guide to apply security fixes
- **REFACTORING_GUIDE.md** - Code refactoring recommendations with examples

### Security Implementations
- **src-tauri/src/commands_secure.rs** - Secure version of Tauri commands with validation
- **src/utils/contentSanitizer.ts** - XSS prevention using DOMPurify
- **src/components/SecurityMonitorDashboard.tsx** - Real-time security monitoring UI
- **src/tests/pentest/penetration-tests.ts** - Comprehensive penetration testing suite

### Performance Optimizations
- **src/hooks/useProjectData.ts** - Memoized project data hook
- **src/hooks/useAudioRecorder.ts** - Memory-safe audio recording hook
- **src-tauri/src/project_storage_async.rs** - Async I/O operations

### CI/CD Security
- **.github/workflows/security.yml** - Automated security scanning workflow

## Critical Security Issues Found

1. **Path Traversal Vulnerability** (Critical)
   - Unrestricted file path access in save_project command
   - Fixed with path canonicalization and validation

2. **XSS Vulnerability** (High)
   - Unsanitized HTML content storage
   - Fixed with DOMPurify sanitization

3. **SSRF Vulnerability** (High)
   - Unrestricted URL access in download_image
   - Fixed with URL validation and domain allowlist

## Quick Start

To apply the security fixes:

```bash
# Run the automated migration script
cd scorm-builder
node scripts/apply-security-fixes.js

# Or apply manually following SECURITY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run security tests
npm test src/tests/security.test.ts

# Run penetration tests (test environment only!)
npm run pentest
```

## Monitoring

The SecurityMonitorDashboard component provides real-time visibility into:
- Security violation attempts
- Blocked malicious requests
- Performance metrics
- Security event history

## Next Steps

1. Review and apply security fixes immediately
2. Run penetration tests in staging environment
3. Deploy security patches to production
4. Enable security monitoring
5. Train development team on secure coding practices
